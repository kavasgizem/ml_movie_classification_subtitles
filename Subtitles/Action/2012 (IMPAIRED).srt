1
00:01:30,104 --> 00:01:34,104
MEGA DENG COOPER MINE, INDIA

2
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:37,105
2009

3
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:39,480
Watch out, watch out!

4
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:45,021
Welcome my friend!

5
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:47,444
- Great to see you!
- Glad you made it

6
00:01:48,783 --> 00:01:49,927
This can't be Ajit.

7
00:01:49,928 --> 00:01:52,490
He's a little man
already. Unbelievable.

8
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:53,935
I hope you're
hungry, Adrian.

9
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:56,112
I'm famished. How
are you, Aparna?

10
00:01:56,113 --> 00:01:57,752
I made that fish
curry you love.

11
00:01:58,075 --> 00:01:59,352
I can't wait.

12
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:01,528
She gets more beautiful
every time I see her,

13
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:02,324
Why is that?

14
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:03,453
Strange, isn't it?

15
00:02:03,454 --> 00:02:06,053
But her fish curry
is still awful.

16
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:08,949
You were mysterious
on the phone.

17
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,393
Why didn't you attend
the conference?

18
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:12,031
I will show you, Adrian, sir.

19
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:14,161
Satnam. Stop sir-ing me.

20
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:22,371
How deep do we need to go?

21
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:24,148
11.000 feet.

22
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:26,791
Searched all over India
for this dig.

23
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29,996
Used to be the deepest
copper mine in the world.

24
00:02:34,798 --> 00:02:37,053
Remember my brother Gurdeep?
He's a student now.

25
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:38,826
Namaste, Dr Helmsley, sir.

26
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:40,881
Adrian. It's just Adrian.

27
00:02:43,756 --> 00:02:45,422
Just don't pour too much, okay?

28
00:02:47,952 --> 00:02:49,488
How do you work
in this heat?

29
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:51,933
You've come on a good
day, my friend.

30
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:54,144
Sometimes it can
be 120° F.

31
00:02:55,648 --> 00:02:57,141
I want you to meet
Dr Lokesh?

32
00:02:57,373 --> 00:02:59,647
Fellow of Quantum Physics
at the University in Chennai

33
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:01,283
- Namaste
- Dr Helmsley

34
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:06,487
So, what are we
looking at?

35
00:03:06,488 --> 00:03:09,671
These neutrinos are
acting normally. No mass,

36
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:11,787
no electrical charge.
They pass through

37
00:03:11,788 --> 00:03:13,481
ordinary matter
almost undisturbed.

38
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:14,727
Your message said
the count doubled

39
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,772
after the last
solar eruptions.

40
00:03:17,027 --> 00:03:18,406
That was last week.

41
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,665
But this happened
two days ago.

42
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:29,625
The biggest solar eruptions
in human history.

43
00:03:29,904 --> 00:03:31,683
Causing the highest
neutrino count

44
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:32,836
we've ever recorded.

45
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:35,359
My God.

46
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:40,429
That's not what
worries me, Adrian.

47
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:42,726
For the first time ever

48
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:46,742
the neutrinos are causing
a physical reaction

49
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,578
That's impossible.

50
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,119
Ah!

51
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,289
That feels very good!

52
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,551
Please, follow me.

53
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:05,947
You wont believe this.

54
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:11,081
This water tank goes
down another 6000 feet.

55
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:14,911
It looks like the neutrinos
coming from the sun

56
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,831
have mutated into a new
kind of nuclear particle.

57
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:27,262
They're heating up
the Earth's core.

58
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,268
And suddenly act
like microwaves.

59
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,492
Ladies and gentlemen.
As promised:

60
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:46,434
No speech!

61
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:48,747
Just a "thank you".

62
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:51,493
Because tonight, with your
extraordinary generosity,

63
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,802
we have raised
1.7 million dollars.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,718
It's okay.

65
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,999
- I work for the White House.
- I don't care who you are, sir

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,677
This is a black tie event.

67
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,189
Scotty!

68
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:10,551
Hey, Adrian, I thought
you were in India

69
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:11,452
What's going on?

70
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:13,103
- I need your jacket
- What?

71
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,076
I gotta speak
to Anheuser

72
00:05:14,077 --> 00:05:15,476
- I don't wanna give...
- Give me your damn jacket!

73
00:05:15,477 --> 00:05:17,003
Take it, please.

74
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:25,709
Easy! That's a
600 dollar jacket.

75
00:05:26,654 --> 00:05:27,979
Mr Anheuser?

76
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:29,940
Mr Anheuser?

77
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:32,435
I need to talk to you.

78
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:36,618
Do I know you?

79
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:38,430
Sorry sir, my name is
Dr Adrian Helmsley

80
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,839
I'm a deputy geologist
at the Office of

81
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,943
Science and Technology Policy

82
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:44,538
Excuse me, fellows.

83
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:47,370
You know that this
is a fund-raiser,

84
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:48,648
not a frat party, right?

85
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,217
It's extremely
important, sir.

86
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:51,956
It always is. Here is
what I want you to do:

87
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:53,790
Make an appointment
or even better,

88
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,400
Have your boss bring it up at
the quarterly science briefing

89
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:57,710
There's a good plan.

90
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:01,008
I just traveled 20 straight
hours to get here, sir.

91
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:04,075
I haven't slept in two days.
You need to read this, sir.

92
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:05,765
You need to read it now!

93
00:06:11,108 --> 00:06:14,173
Let me guess.
National geology crisis?

94
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:16,637
Excuse me.

95
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,079
Who do you
report to?

96
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,568
Lico Vasos

97
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:38,098
Not anymore.

98
00:06:40,844 --> 00:06:42,578
Al, bring the car around.

99
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:45,494
You may wish you
took a shower.

100
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:47,118
You're about to meet
the president.

101
00:06:47,445 --> 00:06:48,554
What's going on?

102
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:50,675
Get that to the office.

103
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:09,322
G8 SUMMIT, BRITISH COLUMBIA

104
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:20,639
Good morning.

105
00:07:20,736 --> 00:07:22,320
I would like to
meet privately

106
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:24,119
with my fellow
heads of state.

107
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,333
Mr <name> wishes to have
his interpreters present.

108
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:32,487
Mr President,
I can assure you

109
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:34,881
Your English is more
than sufficient

110
00:07:34,882 --> 00:07:37,060
for what I have to say.

111
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,709
Mr President.

112
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,555
Six months ago, I was
made aware of a

113
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:08,799
situation so devastating
that at first

114
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,869
I refused to believe it.

115
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,969
However,

116
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:15,518
through the concerted efforts

117
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,120
of our brightest scientists,

118
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:21,797
we have confirmed its validity.

119
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:29,213
The world
as we know it

120
00:08:29,214 --> 00:08:31,480
will soon come
to an end.

121
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:35,851
CHO MING VALLEY, TIBET

122
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,229
This dam project will create
many new jobs.

123
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:48,411
The Party and Country will
assist in your re-location.

124
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:52,221
Grandma, give me
your hand.

125
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:53,592
But where are
they taking us?

126
00:08:53,593 --> 00:08:55,062
It'll be alright.

127
00:08:59,661 --> 00:09:00,903
Brother!

128
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,796
Grandma, I will send you money.

129
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:11,039
Who can write?

130
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:12,667
Who can read?

131
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:15,783
Who can weld?

132
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:30,018
EMPIRE GRAND HOTEL, LONDON

133
00:09:46,515 --> 00:09:47,981
Has His Highness
had an opportunity

134
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:50,071
to study the dossier?

135
00:09:54,297 --> 00:09:58,549
You must understand
I have a big family, Mr...

136
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,093
Isaacs.

137
00:10:00,456 --> 00:10:03,441
One billion dollars is
a lot of money.

138
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:06,563
I'm afraid the amount
is in Euros,

139
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,219
Your Highness.

140
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:13,642
MUSÉE DU LOUVRE, PARIS

141
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:27,278
I put a lot of faith into
your organization.

142
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:31,098
It's a perfect
replica, Roland.

143
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:33,604
There are too many
fanatics out there

144
00:10:33,605 --> 00:10:35,003
that could damage her.

145
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:36,788
Just think about
the beautiful

146
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:39,649
Buddha statues they
blew up in Afghanistan.

147
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,870
Our Heritage Organization
has already made selections

148
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:46,983
from the British Museum
and Hermitage.

149
00:10:53,481 --> 00:10:56,431
I guess she'll be safe now,
tucked away.

150
00:10:56,528 --> 00:11:01,812
Hidden, in some bunker
in Switzerland.

151
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:05,088
Perfectly safe, Roland.

152
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,580
Only infrared analysis can
reveal the difference.

153
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:12,490
But it's still a fake.

154
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:29,051
<i>This mass suicide was actually
discovered by a documentary crew</i>

155
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:31,425
<i>here in the ancient
Mayan city of Takal</i>

156
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:33,449
<i>Now the victims,
and we've seen many,</i>

157
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,752
<i>are said to have adhered
to the Mayan-Quiche calender,</i>

158
00:11:35,785 --> 00:11:37,934
<i>which predicts the
end of time to occur</i>

159
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:40,448
<i>on the 21st December
of this year,</i>

160
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,805
<i>due to the suns
destructive forces.</i>

161
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:43,643
<i>Thank you, Mark.</i>

162
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:46,683
<i>Strangely enough, scientific
records do support the fact</i>

163
00:11:46,684 --> 00:11:49,182
<i>that we are heading for
the biggest solar climax</i>

164
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:51,179

165
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:55,099
MANHATTAN BEACH, CALIFORNIA

166
00:11:57,241 --> 00:11:59,948
<i>Many people believe
that the Mayan Calender</i>

167
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:03,001
<i>predicts that there's supposed
to be a galactic alignment...</i>

168
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:04,542
I'm a dead man.

169
00:12:16,471 --> 00:12:20,083
Hey, Kate, I'm practically
on the freeway right now.

170
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,572
Yes, I'm rolling towards
you as we speak.

171
00:12:24,098 --> 00:12:27,074
Would you relax?
I'll be there any second.

172
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,969
You know it's a vacation and not
a doctors appointment, right?

173
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,585
It's supposed to be fun.

174
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,647
You remember fun,
don't you Kate?

175
00:12:34,648 --> 00:12:35,569
Do you remember
where you were

176
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,887
when it stopped
being fun for you?

177
00:12:39,873 --> 00:12:41,035
Got it.

178
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:46,754
Bug spray?

179
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:49,782
Oh yeah, cause it's mosquito
season in Yellowstone.

180
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:53,674
I got a whole bunch. I gotta go,
I'm in a bad reception area.

181
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:03,546
Woah, man. Would you
look at that?

182
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:05,280
Sick

183
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:12,348
Merrill, I told you.

184
00:13:12,349 --> 00:13:15,285
We have to move back
to Wisconsin.

185
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:18,921
<i>These little mini-quakes are
really getting on my nerves, Randy.</i>

186
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:21,449
<i>Come on, a little surface crack, you're
not gonna be inconvenienced by that</i>

187
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,808
<i>Surface cracks, I've got a
plastic surgeon for that</i>

188
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:27,145
<i>No kidding. Thank God for
those shake-proof coffee mugs.</i>

189
00:13:27,146 --> 00:13:29,060
<i>They show the true nature
of us Californians.</i>

190
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:32,874
<i>We'll not bow to these little
inconvenient things like surface quakes.</i>

191
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,738
<i>Do you have a funny mini-quake
story and want to share it?</i>

192
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:35,699
<i>Call Lisa & Randy at 555...</i>

193
00:13:45,202 --> 00:13:46,792
- Hi daddy!
- Hi baby

194
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:49,077
- How are you sweety?
- Good

195
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,067
Jackson, what is this?
- Please don't call me that.

196
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:53,663
I'm your dad.

197
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:57,314
Taking them camping
in a limo?

198
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:01,065
Okay, great. What happened
to your temp job?

199
00:14:01,748 --> 00:14:03,720
Better hours, more
time to write.

200
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:06,317
What about sleeping, have you
been doing that lately?

201
00:14:06,318 --> 00:14:08,305
I've said it a
thousand times.

202
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,969
No lipo on Fridays.
It's too messy.

203
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,134
Hold on.

204
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:13,388
- Morning Jackson.
- Hi

205
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,240
- Nice ride.
- Thanks.

206
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:18,642
Have a nice trip. Remember,
watch out for the bears.

207
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:20,740
- Bye, Gordon
- Love you, Honey.

208
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:21,595
Bye

209
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:24,586
Okay, so...
- You tell him.

210
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:25,959
Tell me what?

211
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,722
She needs to put these on every
night before she goes to sleep.

212
00:14:28,723 --> 00:14:29,925
Still?

213
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:32,041
Yes. Your 7 year old daughter
still wets her bed.

214
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:33,918
Maybe that's something
you should know.

215
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,890
- Love you
- Love you, Mom.

216
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:38,246
- Hey
- You okay?

217
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,161
They really were looking forward
to spending some time with you

218
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:43,793
I know.

219
00:14:43,794 --> 00:14:45,753
So don't be on your
computer all the time.

220
00:14:45,788 --> 00:14:46,869
Got it.

221
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:52,399
Love you!

222
00:14:56,303 --> 00:14:59,146
- So this time we'll hit Japan.
- So?

223
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:01,243
Now you can visit
your boy, Will.

224
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:02,588
Afternoon, ladies!

225
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:05,600
Are you even
listening to me?

226
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:07,697
Unfortunately I am, Harry.

227
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:09,699
I heard from Audrey you're
a grandpa now.

228
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,903
Would you mind keeping your
nose out of my family?

229
00:15:11,904 --> 00:15:15,105
You're cramping my style, baby.
There we are.

230
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:18,318
So he married a Japanese girl,
how's that the end of the world?

231
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:20,464
Come on Tony, you should
at least go see him.

232
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:23,511
- You see your boy?
- Not as much as I'd like

233
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:25,882
DC is a long way, but
at least we talk

234
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,551
About what?

235
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,751
Life.
And how short it is.

236
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:55,531
What the hell was that?

237
00:16:01,188 --> 00:16:04,091
- Hello?
- Laura?

238
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:05,739
<i>Laura, can you hear me?</i>

239
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,273
Roland, is that you?

240
00:16:07,274 --> 00:16:09,807
<i>Laura, they lied to us.</i>

241
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:11,948
I've arranged a press
conference for tomorrow.

242
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:14,288
I will tell everyone the truth
about what is going on.

243
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:15,933
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

244
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,026
The art you collected

245
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:20,007
is not in the Alps.

246
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:21,462
<i>Those tunnels are empty.</i>

247
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:22,809
<i>I have proof!</i>

248
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,163
Laura, can you hear me?

249
00:16:27,164 --> 00:16:29,257
I'm losing you, Roland.

250
00:16:29,258 --> 00:16:30,881
Laura, can you hear me?

251
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,334
YELLOWSTONE
NATIONAL PARK

252
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:02,093
- I liked that song.
- We lost it.

253
00:17:02,094 --> 00:17:05,336
<i>...the west coast with
all those surface cracks,</i>

254
00:17:05,337 --> 00:17:08,888
<i>I told myself: Charlie,
get your stupid ass</i>

255
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:10,081
<i>to Yellowstone.</i>

256
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:13,692
<i>I don't want to miss all the
fun when it finally goes.</i>

257
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:16,119
<i>Let me tell you, there's been
government people flying</i>

258
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,325
<i>in and out all morning and
trust me, they do not look happy.</i>

259
00:17:21,326 --> 00:17:23,830
Always remember, folks...
- It's weird.

260
00:17:23,831 --> 00:17:26,996
Can you believe
he said that?

261
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:29,087
What are the odds?

262
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,504
We're not seeing the soil
liquefaction we'd expect

263
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:33,306
or any evidence of
fracture propagation

264
00:17:33,307 --> 00:17:34,476
within the tectonic plates.

265
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:36,413
- English, doctor.
- The seismic activity

266
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:38,453
on the west coast is
not caused by tect...

267
00:17:38,454 --> 00:17:40,957
regular earth quakes.
And these surface cracks

268
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,017
have nothing to do
with shifting fault lines.

269
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:45,118
Are you suggesting this
could be the beginning

270
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:47,529
of the Joline operation?
- Dr Helmsley is flying to

271
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,508
Yellowstone to collect
more data, sir.

272
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:53,720
We've been following the schedule
you established, Mr Helmsley.

273
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:55,922
The most important schedule
in the history of mankind.

274
00:17:55,923 --> 00:17:58,941
Now you're telling me we
have to throw it out?

275
00:17:58,942 --> 00:17:59,902
Yes, sir.

276
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:03,710
I was wrong.

277
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:08,024
Do you know how
many times I've heard

278
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:10,024
those words
in this office?

279
00:18:10,664 --> 00:18:12,630
Zero.

280
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:15,289
Did you see this?

281
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,558
I'm sorry Mr President.
She insisted.

282
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,306
It's all over the news.

283
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:25,332
<i>We are learning more about
this deadly car explosion,</i>

284
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,554
<i>The director of the French
National Museum</i>

285
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:29,640
<i>was scheduled to hold
a press conference at</i>

286
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:30,792
<i>the Louvre this morning.</i>

287
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:34,752
<i>Coincidentally, his death took
place in the same Paris tunnel</i>

288
00:18:34,753 --> 00:18:37,910
<i>where Princess Diana
died in 1997.</i>

289
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:41,081
<i>We are continuing to
follow this story...</i>

290
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:45,908
Laura, I don't believe
you've met Dr Helmsley.

291
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:48,100
I just talked to him Dad,
and he told me...

292
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:49,937
the organization I
work for is a sham.

293
00:18:49,938 --> 00:18:51,663
Why would he say that?

294
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:58,351
You look just like your mother
when you get upset.

295
00:18:58,352 --> 00:19:02,059
- Did I ever tell you that?
- Every time I get upset.

296
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,434
Daddy, a man was killed.

297
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:09,682
Honey. Please sit down.

298
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,150
Only a dozen people
in this administration

299
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:22,974
know what I'm
about to tell you.

300
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,421
Dad, what's going on?

301
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:31,974
An unprecedented
international endeavor

302
00:19:31,975 --> 00:19:32,935
is under way.

303
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:38,312
At this point 46 nations
are invested in this thing.

304
00:19:38,313 --> 00:19:40,188
Laura's a smart girl.
She'll understand.

305
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:42,021
That thing in Paris.

306
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,966
We're not involved in
any of that, are we?

307
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:45,824
"We"?
Who the hell is "we"?

308
00:19:45,825 --> 00:19:47,325
What are you
talking about?

309
00:19:47,442 --> 00:19:49,960
What we need to do is
focus on this time line.

310
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:51,497
So when do we let
the country know?

311
00:19:51,498 --> 00:19:54,375
What do you mean?
- The people, sir.

312
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:56,335
They need to know.

313
00:19:56,939 --> 00:19:59,732
Well of course
they do. Listen.

314
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:03,128
Your job is to figure out when
this is all gonna fall apart.

315
00:20:03,163 --> 00:20:06,524
My job is to figure out how to
retain some type of government

316
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:07,982
after it falls apart.

317
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:09,853
Until then we don't have
time for anything

318
00:20:09,854 --> 00:20:11,897
except those jobs. Okay?

319
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:15,553
Call me when you have
any news from Yellowstone.

320
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,355
- Cute girl, huh?
- Sir?

321
00:20:19,356 --> 00:20:21,133
The First Daughter,
I saw you looking at her.

322
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:24,298
- I wasn't looking at her
- Better move fast kid

323
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,357
The end is near.

324
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:28,599
Your chopper's ready.

325
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,119
They're waiting
on the south lawn.

326
00:20:32,257 --> 00:20:37,526
- Daddy, where are we going?
- This special place I know

327
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,186
Actually, it's a place
where your mom and I

328
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:40,294
used to hang out a lot.

329
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:42,629
I don't want to know
where you and mom had sex.

330
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,914
I'm not ready
for that, Jackson.

331
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:46,818
Stop calling me that,
it's creeping me out.

332
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:48,388
What's wrong with "Dad"?

333
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:51,494
Daddy, look at this.

334
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:53,022
That wasn't here before.

335
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:55,905
What did I do?

336
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:57,988
Go get your hat.

337
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:04,180
Can't you see the signs?

338
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,708
There used to be
a lake here.

339
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:15,964
Doesn't look much
of a lake to me.

340
00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:18,357
I know. The whole
damn thing's gone.

341
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,291
Come on, let's
check it out.

342
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:22,680
Great.

343
00:21:43,714 --> 00:21:46,748
Subjects have now
entered hot zone.

344
00:21:59,295 --> 00:22:00,694
What is that?

345
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:03,992
It's the U.S. Army.

346
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,981
All manner of
government vehicle

347
00:22:14,982 --> 00:22:17,005
are converging
on subjects.

348
00:22:17,198 --> 00:22:18,613
You're in a
restricted area, sir.

349
00:22:18,614 --> 00:22:20,220
We need you and your
family to come with us.

350
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:23,727
Right. Okay, we're gonna
go with these guys.

351
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:24,935
That'll be fun, huh?

352
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:31,746
This is wild.
This is really wild.

353
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,286
This is unbelievable.
2700° C at 40.000 feet?

354
00:22:46,287 --> 00:22:48,495
I know, it sounds
completely implausible.

355
00:22:48,496 --> 00:22:51,895
Nonetheless, we're noticing
an increase of almost 0.5%

356
00:22:51,896 --> 00:22:54,002
- Per day?
- No.

357
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:54,817
Per hour.

358
00:22:54,818 --> 00:22:58,296
Dr Helmsley, we arrested
some tourists in the hot zone.

359
00:22:58,297 --> 00:22:59,319
I'll take care of it.

360
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,686
Let's get Satnam on the
communications link.

361
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:04,172
Cross reference the data.

362
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:07,969
It's a national park, there's
not supposed to be fences.

363
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,198
What's going on here?

364
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:11,221
We're geologists.

365
00:23:11,646 --> 00:23:14,120
You usually go digging
with machine guns?

366
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,366
Major, I'll take care
of this, thank you.

367
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:18,696
So what happened
to the lake?

368
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,636
Well that's what we're
trying to find out.

369
00:23:20,637 --> 00:23:22,362
We think the entire area
has become unstable.

370
00:23:22,363 --> 00:23:24,848
I think you should take
your kids and leave, Mr...

371
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:26,092
Curtis.

372
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:29,062
You're not by any chance
the Jackson Curtis who

373
00:23:29,097 --> 00:23:31,962
wrote "Farewell Atlantis"?

374
00:23:34,142 --> 00:23:35,331
The very same.

375
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:39,121
It's actually dedicated
to my mom.

376
00:23:41,101 --> 00:23:44,839
I read a couple of your
short stories in college.

377
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,664
Your father is a
very talented man

378
00:23:47,665 --> 00:23:48,257
Listen up.

379
00:23:48,258 --> 00:23:49,890
It's amazing.
I'm reading your book.

380
00:23:49,891 --> 00:23:51,918
I'm around day 300,
the shuttle has just

381
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,145
lost communication
with Earth.

382
00:23:53,146 --> 00:23:55,051
You're one of the lucky
few who bought it.

383
00:23:55,052 --> 00:23:57,390
- I didn't buy it.
- No?

384
00:23:57,391 --> 00:23:59,329
My dad gave
it to me.

385
00:24:00,444 --> 00:24:02,662
Let me ask
you something.

386
00:24:02,663 --> 00:24:04,798
Do you think those people
would behave so selflessly

387
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,101
knowing that their own
lives were at stake?

388
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:08,936
I hope so.

389
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:12,144
The critics said I was naive,
an unabashed optimist,

390
00:24:12,145 --> 00:24:13,788
but what do
they know, right?

391
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:18,169
It was a great pleasure
meeting you.

392
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,880
Mayor, could you escort
these good people

393
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:20,888
to the camp
grounds, please.

394
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:21,848
This is yours.

395
00:24:22,312 --> 00:24:23,283
- Thank you
- Yes, sir.

396
00:24:23,284 --> 00:24:25,297
- Take care.
- Okay

397
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:26,324
He was very nice.

398
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:28,588
You're just saying that
cause you like my book.

399
00:24:33,784 --> 00:24:35,336
Looks like that boy
of yours is gonna be

400
00:24:35,337 --> 00:24:36,653
smarter than any of us.

401
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:42,759
What's wrong?

402
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,724
I sent Satnam the
temperature readings.

403
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:47,945
My colleagues in Argentina
and Ontario have

404
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,769
almost identical data.

405
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,059
It's so hot here we've
had to seal off the mine.

406
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,127
Did you double check
the numbers?

407
00:24:53,162 --> 00:24:54,749
I triple checked,
my friend.

408
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,164
I wish we were
wrong, but

409
00:24:57,165 --> 00:24:58,124
we're not.

410
00:24:59,344 --> 00:25:02,413
The Earth's crust is
destabilizing.

411
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,724
It's too early.

412
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,388
Adrian. You have to
begin the evacuation.

413
00:25:13,189 --> 00:25:14,817
My God.

414
00:25:14,818 --> 00:25:18,311
All our scientific advances,
our fancy machines,

415
00:25:18,312 --> 00:25:21,275
the Mayans saw this coming
thousands of years ago.

416
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:32,358
I thought we'd
have more time.

417
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,123
Okay.

418
00:25:41,592 --> 00:25:43,488
Okay, I want you to
pack up your family.

419
00:25:43,489 --> 00:25:46,083
I'm gonna arrange
an airlift from Delhi.

420
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:48,028
Thank you my friend.

421
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:49,919
And good luck.

422
00:25:58,137 --> 00:25:59,803
Ajit.

423
00:26:00,728 --> 00:26:02,779
We are going
on a big ship.

424
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,502
Wait. Wait, wait.

425
00:26:14,537 --> 00:26:16,985
Sorry. One question.

426
00:26:16,986 --> 00:26:22,550
What did the government
guys say to you?

427
00:26:24,955 --> 00:26:27,626
They don't like us going
over their fences and

428
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:31,008
that the whole area
back there is unstable.

429
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:31,929
"Unstable"?

430
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,234
They said "unstable"?

431
00:26:37,068 --> 00:26:38,683
That's funny.

432
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:39,644
Let's go.

433
00:26:43,232 --> 00:26:45,548
"Unstable".

434
00:26:50,053 --> 00:26:51,964
It's not just
Yellowstone, sir.

435
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:54,625
Temperatures are rising
with incredible velocity

436
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:56,465
in hot zones across
the globe.

437
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:58,979
Are you absolutely sure
about this, Adrian?

438
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,845
Once we give these orders,
there's no going back.

439
00:27:02,846 --> 00:27:05,898
I'm afraid there's
no longer any doubt.

440
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:07,711
We have to save
what we can.

441
00:27:07,712 --> 00:27:10,171
And we have
to move now!

442
00:27:38,594 --> 00:27:42,665
There's mosquitoes in here.
Did anybody spray the tent?

443
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:44,736
I'm gonna get that
spray tomorrow.

444
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:47,473
They just like you because
your blood's so sweet.

445
00:27:48,256 --> 00:27:50,936
Dad, you said you wouldn't
work on your book.

446
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:51,825
What?

447
00:27:51,826 --> 00:27:54,875
I'm not, I'm doing
something else.

448
00:27:57,618 --> 00:27:59,096
Okay.

449
00:28:02,068 --> 00:28:03,830
Did you really need
all these hats?

450
00:28:03,831 --> 00:28:05,154
Where are
your pull-ups?

451
00:28:05,155 --> 00:28:06,682
I have them on.

452
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:14,884
Who gave you this?
Mommy?

453
00:28:14,885 --> 00:28:17,705
No, Gordon gave it to me
for my birthday.

454
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,344
A cell phone is something
we got to talk about

455
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:21,305
As a family.

456
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,722
What family?

457
00:28:27,976 --> 00:28:30,897
It hurts my feelings when
you say stuff like that.

458
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:34,079
Go away.

459
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:42,844
Adults get hurt feelings too.

460
00:28:59,486 --> 00:29:00,807
No way.

461
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:02,004
<i>...tell the truth.</i>

462
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:04,032
<i>Thank you, Bill.
What is your question?</i>

463
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,735
<i>I wanted to know, where
is all this gonna start?</i>

464
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:08,962
<i>Well, something like this could
only originate in Hollywood.</i>

465
00:29:08,963 --> 00:29:12,440
<i>They have the earth cracking
under their asses already.</i>

466
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:15,138
<i>Our family believes in the
gospel of the lord Jesus.</i>

467
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:16,454
<i>We have nothing
to fear, Charlie.</i>

468
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,509
Good for you, Bill.
Thanks for calling.

469
00:29:18,736 --> 00:29:21,636
This is Charlie Frost
reporting live from

470
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:25,071
Yellowstone National Park,
soon to become the worlds

471
00:29:25,072 --> 00:29:29,005
largest active volcano.

472
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:31,094
I'll be right back, folks.

473
00:29:33,311 --> 00:29:35,357
Do you mind
if I join you?

474
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:36,606
I wanted to ask
you something.

475
00:29:36,806 --> 00:29:40,389
I only got a minute.
Pickle?

476
00:29:41,595 --> 00:29:43,876
I was listening to the broadcast
and I was wondering

477
00:29:43,877 --> 00:29:47,425
what exactly is it that's
gonna start in Hollywood?

478
00:29:47,426 --> 00:29:51,352
It's the Apocalypse.
End of days.

479
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:54,896
The Judgment Day. The end
of the world, my friend.

480
00:29:54,925 --> 00:29:57,654
Christians call it The Rapture,
but the Mayans

481
00:29:57,655 --> 00:29:59,597
knew about it, the Hopis,

482
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:04,264
The I Ching, the Bible.

483
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:07,040
- Beer?
- Yeah.

484
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,773
So look, I gotta eat.

485
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:11,453
Why don't you
download my blog?

486
00:30:11,454 --> 00:30:15,980
It's free. Of course, we do
appreciate donations.

487
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,584
<i>In ancient times, the Mayan
people were the first</i>

488
00:30:18,585 --> 00:30:20,991
<i>civilization to discover
that this planet had</i>

489
00:30:20,992 --> 00:30:24,043
<i>an expiration date.
According to their calender,</i>

490
00:30:24,044 --> 00:30:27,671
<i>in the year 2012 a
cataclysmic event will unfold,</i>

491
00:30:27,672 --> 00:30:30,533
<i>caused by an alignment
of the planets in our solar system</i>

492
00:30:30,568 --> 00:30:34,701
<i>that only happens
every 640.000 years.</i>

493
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:36,329
<i>Oh, not again.</i>

494
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:40,483
Neat, huh? I did all
the animation myself.

495
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,024
<i>Just imagine the earth
as an orange</i>

496
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:47,159
You lure them in
with humor.

497
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,499
Then you make
them think.

498
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,803
<i>Our sun will begin to emit such
extreme amounts of radiation,</i>

499
00:30:51,827 --> 00:30:54,167
<i>Screw you bastards.</i>

500
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:56,499
<i>That the core of the earth
will melt at the inside</i>

501
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,460
<i>part of the orange.</i>

502
00:30:57,742 --> 00:31:00,625
<i>Leaving the crust of our
planet free to shift.</i>

503
00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:04,020
<i>In 1958 Professor Charles
Hapgood named it:</i>

504
00:31:04,055 --> 00:31:04,989
<i>"Earth Crust Displacement"</i>

505
00:31:05,024 --> 00:31:08,593
<i>Albert Einstein
did support it.</i>

506
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:11,242
<i>People will get it all, the
forces of Mother Nature</i>

507
00:31:11,243 --> 00:31:14,094
<i>will be so devastating
It will bring an end to</i>

508
00:31:14,095 --> 00:31:18,651
<i>this world on winter
Solstice 12-21-12.</i>

509
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:21,687
<i>Always remember, folks.
You heard it first from</i>

510
00:31:21,722 --> 00:31:22,838
<i>Charlie Frost.</i>

511
00:31:23,428 --> 00:31:26,486
You'd have to keep a thing
like this under wraps.

512
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:27,996
Just think about it.

513
00:31:28,123 --> 00:31:30,884
First, the stock market would go.

514
00:31:30,885 --> 00:31:33,154
Then the economy: Boom!

515
00:31:33,155 --> 00:31:34,372
The dollar: Boom!

516
00:31:34,407 --> 00:31:36,558
And then pandemonium
in the street.

517
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,342
War, genocide.
Boom Boom Boom!

518
00:31:40,343 --> 00:31:43,592
Bullshit. Nobody could keep
that big a secret, Charlie.

519
00:31:43,593 --> 00:31:44,485
Somebody would blow
the whistle

520
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:48,331
An every once in a while,
some poor sucker tries.

521
00:31:48,332 --> 00:31:50,825
Like these guys.
Boom! Boom!

522
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,660
Every one of these
guys: Dead! Dead! Dead!

523
00:31:56,204 --> 00:31:59,570
Woah, that's
Professor Meyers.

524
00:31:59,602 --> 00:32:01,710
He ran the Atlantis
Shuttle Program.

525
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,607
Did you know him?

526
00:32:02,642 --> 00:32:04,639
- Yeah, he helped me out
with research on my book.

527
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,668
Well, that must have been
before his accident.

528
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:11,417
- Meyers is dead?
- Yeah, two months ago.

529
00:32:11,452 --> 00:32:14,787
He was one of my
most avid listeners.

530
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:16,120
He had it all figured out.

531
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:19,737
Everything the government
was doing, where, why.

532
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:22,585
He even sent me a map.

533
00:32:22,623 --> 00:32:26,481
A map for what, Charlie?
What's the map for?

534
00:32:31,591 --> 00:32:36,624
They're building
space ships, man.

535
00:32:41,368 --> 00:32:47,104
Shit, man, I have to go.
I gotta get back to Earth.

536
00:32:47,128 --> 00:32:49,805
- Do you have a beer?
- This is my last.

537
00:32:49,806 --> 00:32:52,867
- Alright, I really enjoyed
most of this.

538
00:32:52,868 --> 00:32:55,696
Thank you so much.

539
00:32:55,697 --> 00:32:57,543
- Guess what, they're
selling seats!

540
00:32:57,544 --> 00:32:58,543
- Put me down for three.

541
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:00,984
- No! Guys like you and me
don't have any chance.

542
00:33:00,985 --> 00:33:03,640
You'd have to be Bill Gates
or Rupert Murdoch

543
00:33:03,641 --> 00:33:05,694
or some Russian
billionaire.

544
00:33:05,695 --> 00:33:07,564
Keep it down, my kids
are sleeping.

545
00:33:07,565 --> 00:33:13,098
Get them out of Yellowstone.
It's gonna get ugly here.

546
00:33:16,318 --> 00:33:18,706
Why don't we
make a baby?

547
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:23,054
We're not making a baby
at the supermarket.

548
00:33:23,955 --> 00:33:27,018
Hands off the
merchandise.

549
00:33:27,704 --> 00:33:30,198
Honey, woman give me
thousands of dollars

550
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:32,567
to handle their boobs.
You get it for free.

551
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,120
You always act strange
after he shows up.

552
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:56,506
I'm not acting strange,
I'm looking for macaroni.

553
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:01,021
So why did you stick with
him so long anyways?

554
00:34:01,022 --> 00:34:02,470
Can we just give
it a rest, please?

555
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:05,950
- He's the father of my children.
- Oh, come on, Kate

556
00:34:05,968 --> 00:34:08,109
You gave up med school so
you could have Noah.

557
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:10,241
You practically raised him
and Lilly by yourself

558
00:34:10,242 --> 00:34:12,380
while he sat glued to a
laptop writing that junk.

559
00:34:12,381 --> 00:34:14,923
It's not junk!
He's published.

560
00:34:14,924 --> 00:34:16,515
Oh, published.
Right, I forgot.

561
00:34:16,516 --> 00:34:19,575
422 copies.

562
00:34:32,977 --> 00:34:35,673
- Did you see that?
- See what?

563
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:38,766
Kate, listen, we have to
keep working at this.

564
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:40,229
Our relationship.

565
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,973
I don't know, Honey, I feel
like there's something

566
00:34:43,974 --> 00:34:45,460
pulling us apart.

567
00:34:49,279 --> 00:34:53,809
Grab the pole!
Kate, don't let go!

568
00:34:56,966 --> 00:34:59,490
Do you have anything
for mosquito bites?

569
00:34:59,491 --> 00:35:01,412
Before or after?

570
00:35:02,277 --> 00:35:04,904
- I'll get before and after.
- Stop scratching or you're

571
00:35:04,905 --> 00:35:06,409
gonna get it all infected.

572
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,283
<i>...and I had to make a quick
stop at the grocery store...</i>

573
00:35:09,284 --> 00:35:10,503
It's Mrs Birnbaum

574
00:35:10,504 --> 00:35:13,658
She's my teacher.
She's on TV!

575
00:35:14,175 --> 00:35:16,309
<i>...market which was open
for business at the time</i>

576
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:19,337
<i>but fortunately there are no
fatalities or injuries reported.</i>

577
00:35:19,338 --> 00:35:22,412
<i>It really is a miracle
that no one got hurt.</i>

578
00:35:22,436 --> 00:35:25,131
Hello? Hi mom.

579
00:35:25,132 --> 00:35:27,811
Did you see what happened
to our supermarket?

580
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,202
She wants us to
come home.

581
00:35:32,226 --> 00:35:33,464
Is this even possible?

582
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,653
We worked every
option through the night.

583
00:35:35,654 --> 00:35:38,054
The good news: consensus
is that 4 of the Arks

584
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:39,794
will be operational in time.

585
00:35:39,795 --> 00:35:41,606
- Only 4? You call
that good news?

586
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:43,838
- We can save over
400.000 people.

587
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,973
To me, sir, that's nothing
short of a miracle.

588
00:35:45,974 --> 00:35:48,351
But we have to initiate
the boarding process now.

589
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:52,056
Thomas. We don't
have a choice.

590
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:55,255
You have got to
convince them.

591
00:35:58,136 --> 00:36:01,736
According to the
latest information...

592
00:36:01,749 --> 00:36:04,361
- Please continue, Adrian.
- Thank you, sir.

593
00:36:04,403 --> 00:36:06,584
The temperature of the
subterranean crust,

594
00:36:06,585 --> 00:36:10,637
that is the cement that holds
our landmass in place,

595
00:36:10,638 --> 00:36:13,842
Is increasing at a rapid rate
much faster than anticipated.

596
00:36:13,853 --> 00:36:16,869
As a result we've observed
extreme polar instability

597
00:36:16,893 --> 00:36:18,577
The magnetic fields
have decreased

598
00:36:18,578 --> 00:36:21,353
by more than 80%
in the last 48 hours.

599
00:36:21,354 --> 00:36:25,010
<i>How much time do we
have, Dr Helmsley?</i>

600
00:36:26,604 --> 00:36:29,168
Two, maybe three days,
if we're lucky.

601
00:36:29,202 --> 00:36:32,782
<i>How can you speak about
luck in such a situation?</i>

602
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:36,649
Apologies, Mr Prime Minister.

603
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,563
I meant no disrespect.

604
00:36:39,004 --> 00:36:41,721
I'm afraid the
longer we wait,

605
00:36:41,722 --> 00:36:44,114
the more luck
plays its part.

606
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,849
My friends.

607
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:55,046
I recommend we
evacuate immediately.

608
00:36:56,093 --> 00:36:59,280
If any of you
have objections

609
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:02,126
Please speak now.

You shut up while I talk

619
00:37:37,185 --> 00:37:41,185
- Yes, Mr Karpov.
- Good. That is good.

620
00:37:41,373 --> 00:37:43,411
Zultan, listen to me.

621
00:37:43,438 --> 00:37:46,997
We are fighters,
we never go down.

hard they hit us.

00:39:02,158 --> 00:39:03,212
Rise and shine.

634
00:39:13,414 --> 00:39:15,362
Alright, you're free.

635
00:39:17,717 --> 00:39:19,442
Mommy!

636
00:39:20,535 --> 00:39:22,394
Hi, sweetheart.

637
00:39:26,151 --> 00:39:27,361
Gordon!

638
00:39:28,585 --> 00:39:30,833
Hey, buddy boy.

639
00:39:31,545 --> 00:39:32,499
Had a good time?

640
00:39:33,907 --> 00:39:35,699
God, I missed you.

641
00:39:36,845 --> 00:39:38,857
- Who wants pancakes?
- Me!

642
00:39:43,158 --> 00:39:44,996
Thanks for bringing
them home early.

643
00:39:44,997 --> 00:39:45,957
Yeah.

644
00:39:47,197 --> 00:39:48,720
Pancakes?

645
00:39:50,218 --> 00:39:52,087
Late for work.

646
00:40:02,175 --> 00:40:05,324
- Yes, hello?
- Curtis, where are you?

647
00:40:05,325 --> 00:40:08,459
- Just back from vacation, sir.
- Good. That is good.

648
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,520
I will send a jet to pick
up Alec and Oleg.

649
00:40:11,521 --> 00:40:14,032
Yuri bear. Tell him to bring
the rain coat for Caesar.

650
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:15,477
It's in the Range Rover.

651
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:16,860
- Curtis?
- Yeah

652
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:18,723
Get my boys as
fast as you can.

653
00:40:18,724 --> 00:40:20,720
I'm hurling towards
you as we speak, sir.

654
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:22,490
Good. That is good.

655
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:39,826
- Curtis, you're late.
- Good morning to you too.

656
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:45,892
Be careful with our stuff.

657
00:40:45,927 --> 00:40:48,777
Don't get your dirt
on it. Idiot.

658
00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:57,797
Took you a while,
Mr. Curtis.

659
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:04,448
What's your problem?
Be more careful.

660
00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:05,824
He did that
on purpose.

661
00:41:05,825 --> 00:41:08,562
Have a safe trip,
you little bastards.

662
00:41:08,597 --> 00:41:10,090
Now you're
laughing, Curtis.

663
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:12,722
But we have tickets
to go on a big ship.

664
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:16,145
We will leave,
and you will die.

665
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:31,062
<i>Did you hear that?
The authorities in L.A.</i>

666
00:41:31,063 --> 00:41:33,240
<i>say there's nothing
to worry about.</i>

667
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:36,565
<i>I'd love to see their
faces when Malibu</i>

668
00:41:36,566 --> 00:41:42,083
<i>and Beverly Hills sink
down into the Pacific.</i>

669
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:45,388
<i>Where will they plug in
their electric cars then?</i>

670
00:41:48,846 --> 00:41:49,748
Hey!

671
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:51,714
- Is this your plane?
- Yeah

672
00:41:51,749 --> 00:41:53,255
- Are you a pilot?
- Yeah

673
00:41:53,256 --> 00:41:54,196
I want to rent it, okay?

674
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:55,136
I'll give anything you want.

675
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,656
Here, take this very
expensive watch.

676
00:41:56,657 --> 00:41:58,001
My neighbor gave it
to me when he

677
00:41:58,036 --> 00:41:59,346
thought I was gonna
be somebody.

678
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:06,551
<i>...CalTech, that in the
last 36 hours we have</i>

679
00:42:06,552 --> 00:42:10,182
<i>basically zero earthquake
activity in Southern California,</i>

680
00:42:10,183 --> 00:42:11,706
<i>which is very rare.</i>

681
00:42:11,707 --> 00:42:14,681
<i>Unlike the tough characters
I have portrayed in my films...</i>

682
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:15,642
Hello?

683
00:42:16,196 --> 00:42:18,020
Hey. Stop what you're doing.
- Jackson?

684
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:20,665
Listen to me. I've rented
a plane, pack up the kids,

685
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:22,928
I'm gonna be there
in 5 minutes.

686
00:42:22,929 --> 00:42:23,742
What are you
talking about?

687
00:42:23,743 --> 00:42:24,964
We're gonna have
a regular Saturday.

688
00:42:24,965 --> 00:42:26,649
Noah has music at 2:00
and Lilly has karate.

689
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,151
You expect him
to remember?

690
00:42:28,152 --> 00:42:30,529
Kate, California
is going down.

691
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,592
- Pack up the kids now!
- They just got back.

692
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,178
God, you sound like
a crazy person.

693
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:37,172
The governor just said
we're fine now.

694
00:42:37,173 --> 00:42:39,726
The guy's an actor, he's
reading a script!

695
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:42,052
When they tell you
not to panic

696
00:42:42,053 --> 00:42:43,955
That's when you run!

697
00:42:43,956 --> 00:42:47,007
Will you call me back
when you calm down?

698
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:49,770
Mommy, why are you
acting so crazy?

699
00:42:52,222 --> 00:42:53,890
Finish your pancakes,
Al Capone.

700
00:42:54,429 --> 00:42:58,279
<i>...it seems to me that
the worst is over.</i>

701
00:43:14,446 --> 00:43:15,174
Hold Mommy's hands!

702
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:22,573
Let's go!
- I think it's safer under here!

703
00:43:22,574 --> 00:43:25,745
Get in the fucking car!

704
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,434
Come on, kids!

705
00:43:38,436 --> 00:43:40,923
Get in. Get in.

706
00:43:40,924 --> 00:43:41,884
My hats!

707
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:48,594
Buckle up!

708
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:58,575
Sorry.

709
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,217
Jackson. Hurry up!
Look behind you!

710
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:16,947
Oh God.

711
00:44:22,376 --> 00:44:24,010
Get out of the way!
- Move it!

712
00:44:24,011 --> 00:44:26,276
Hold on, dear.

713
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:27,236
Come on,
you old bags!

714
00:44:57,618 --> 00:44:59,149
We gotta get to Santa
Monica Airport.

715
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,342
Take the freeway. It'll
be half the time.

716
00:45:04,394 --> 00:45:05,393
Yeah, right.

717
00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:16,900
We gotta get to the other
side of the freeway.

718
00:45:43,766 --> 00:45:44,449
Dad, look!

719
00:45:58,951 --> 00:46:01,587
They've just been upgraded
to a 10.9 by Harvard.

720
00:46:01,588 --> 00:46:03,347
What does CalTech
have to say?

721
00:46:03,348 --> 00:46:05,526
The city of Pasadena
was wiped out.

722
00:46:05,527 --> 00:46:07,090
Just a few
minutes ago.

723
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:09,468
This is coming in live
from Coachella Valley

724
00:46:09,469 --> 00:46:11,286
near Joshua Tree.
That huge canyon,

725
00:46:11,287 --> 00:46:12,528
It wasn't there
this morning.

726
00:46:13,322 --> 00:46:17,352
100 miles further North,
same thing.

727
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,656
The San Andreas Fault
is shifting.

728
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:20,617
Yes.

729
00:46:20,618 --> 00:46:23,209
And all major sister
faults in the bay area.

730
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:26,282
The whole Pacific Plate
is destabilizing.

731
00:46:35,689 --> 00:46:36,745
Come on!

732
00:46:37,033 --> 00:46:39,240
- Who's that?
- Our pilot.

733
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,544
Dead pilot!

734
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,272
Gordon!
You can fly!

735
00:46:43,465 --> 00:46:45,472
I've only had a couple
of lessons in a

736
00:46:45,473 --> 00:46:47,149
single engine
plane only.

737
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,841
- You're the guy!
- No, I'm not the guy!

738
00:46:48,842 --> 00:46:50,036
Trust me!
You're the guy.

739
00:46:50,037 --> 00:46:52,148
I'm not being
modest about this!

740
00:46:52,202 --> 00:46:53,415
Come on, kids.

741
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:54,806
Gordon's gonna
get us out of here.

742
00:46:54,807 --> 00:46:57,129
That plane has
multiple engines.

743
00:46:58,155 --> 00:46:59,498
Jackson!

744
00:47:14,085 --> 00:47:16,004
- T's and P's
- TNP?

745
00:47:16,006 --> 00:47:17,541
- What?
- Temperatures and Pressures

746
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:18,925
- Let's go!
- My preflight check

747
00:47:18,926 --> 00:47:20,230
Let him concentrate,
Jackson.

748
00:47:20,423 --> 00:47:22,054
He has no experience.

749
00:47:22,151 --> 00:47:23,303
Thank you.

750
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:26,662
Gordon! Go!

751
00:47:26,663 --> 00:47:27,623
Go go go!

752
00:47:30,695 --> 00:47:32,998
We're not there yet.

753
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:36,209
- Punch it!
- We need 85 knots.

754
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:37,990
- 80 is good!
- Let's do it.

755
00:47:44,804 --> 00:47:46,339
Okay, we're up.

756
00:48:59,011 --> 00:49:01,218
Lilly, go sit with
your brother.

757
00:49:05,633 --> 00:49:07,744
How did you know
this would happen?

758
00:49:08,942 --> 00:49:10,720
It's not just California.

759
00:49:10,912 --> 00:49:13,451
The whole damn world
is going to shit.

760
00:49:13,696 --> 00:49:16,383
I met this crazy guy
in Yellowstone

761
00:49:16,384 --> 00:49:18,303
But he's been right about
everything so far

762
00:49:18,592 --> 00:49:20,586
He said the government
is building these ships,

763
00:49:20,621 --> 00:49:21,674
space ships,
I don't know what,

764
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,295
but something...
- Space ships?

765
00:49:23,584 --> 00:49:25,119
Yeah. Places where
we could be safe.

766
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,998
He knows where they
are. He's got a map.

767
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,551
- Jackson...
- Kate, trust me on this.

768
00:49:31,744 --> 00:49:34,623
Guys. Look.

769
00:50:02,453 --> 00:50:05,523
<i>But it ain't the end
of the world, Buddy.</i>

770
00:50:05,716 --> 00:50:08,403
<i>It's only the end
of this song.</i>

771
00:50:08,595 --> 00:50:12,145
<i>It's been a gas, been a
flip, been a hell of a trip,</i>

772
00:50:12,147 --> 00:50:16,753
<i>But it ain't the end
of the world.</i>

773
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:19,537
Oh yeah!

774
00:50:19,634 --> 00:50:22,513
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You got fans, Tony.

775
00:50:24,529 --> 00:50:26,426
There's a call for you, Harry.
Want me to take a message?

776
00:50:26,449 --> 00:50:28,368
No, thats alright.

777
00:50:33,648 --> 00:50:34,608
Yeah, hello?

778
00:50:34,801 --> 00:50:37,008
- Dad?
- Adrian!

779
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:40,367
Remember I told you
about that dam in China?

780
00:50:40,847 --> 00:50:44,302
- Yeah.
- It's happening, Dad.

781
00:50:53,804 --> 00:50:56,778
They'd probably shoot me
if they knew I told you.

782
00:50:57,451 --> 00:50:59,279
Nobody's gonna
shoot you, son.

783
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,240
They need you.

784
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:02,118
The President has
ordered us to

785
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:03,846
clear out the
White House.

786
00:51:04,344 --> 00:51:06,985
About time somebody
cleaned up that mess.

787
00:51:09,765 --> 00:51:11,574
Where are you, Dad?

788
00:51:11,792 --> 00:51:14,850
What is the course of
The Genesis right now?

789
00:51:14,858 --> 00:51:17,482
It's all good, Adrian.

790
00:51:17,483 --> 00:51:20,268
Don't you be worrying
about your old man.

791
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:23,428
You have more important
things to do now.

792
00:51:25,591 --> 00:51:27,147
You know...

793
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:30,219
Your mom and I...

794
00:51:30,493 --> 00:51:33,259
We had one hell of
a great life, son.

795
00:51:34,897 --> 00:51:38,181
And the best
part about that...

796
00:51:39,244 --> 00:51:42,843
We had one hell of
a great kid, too.

797
00:51:47,454 --> 00:51:51,238
This Genesis is a pretty
big ship, son.

798
00:51:51,432 --> 00:51:55,558
Don't you write your
old man off just yet.

799
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:57,382
Besides...

800
00:51:58,051 --> 00:52:01,202
You know I couldn't
leave Tony alone.

801
00:52:01,321 --> 00:52:05,654
That old fool can't keep
decent time by himself.

802
00:52:07,107 --> 00:52:09,199
I love you, Dad.

803
00:52:14,425 --> 00:52:18,782
I love you too, son.
God knows I do.

804
00:52:31,162 --> 00:52:34,233
Herb. I want a double.

805
00:52:34,868 --> 00:52:37,218
- Harry...
- I need a double.

806
00:52:41,545 --> 00:52:43,379
Thank you, son.

807
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,513
After 25 year on
the wagon.

808
00:52:48,514 --> 00:52:50,406
Are you out
of your mind?

809
00:53:05,824 --> 00:53:07,123
- What are you doing?
- Gotta go.

810
00:53:07,124 --> 00:53:08,589
That's against
regulation!

811
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:15,134
Anything?

812
00:53:15,235 --> 00:53:16,507
Yeah, there's fuel.
Fill her up, I'm gonna

813
00:53:16,514 --> 00:53:17,493
gonna go find Charlie.

814
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:19,303
Daddy, wait, I wanna
come with you!

815
00:53:19,304 --> 00:53:20,838
No Lil! No!

816
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:22,223
It's alright, I'll take her.
Just fill it up

817
00:53:22,224 --> 00:53:23,180
I'll be right back.

818
00:53:23,185 --> 00:53:24,398
Jackson, hurry please!

819
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:27,866
<i>I'm standing here at
the highest point</i>

820
00:53:27,886 --> 00:53:29,666
<i>of what is the rim
of the worlds</i>

821
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:34,110
<i>largest super volcano,
Mount Big Horn.</i>

822
00:53:34,143 --> 00:53:36,535
Charlie!

823
00:53:39,396 --> 00:53:40,952
<i>I can only hope</i>

824
00:53:41,144 --> 00:53:43,735
<i>that all of you have
made your peace</i>

825
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:44,983
It's gotta be around
here somewhere.

826
00:53:44,984 --> 00:53:46,791
- Let's go back, Daddy.
- No no no

827
00:53:46,792 --> 00:53:48,936
We gotta find Charlie,
cause he's got a map.

828
00:53:48,971 --> 00:53:51,081
It's like a secret map.
Like in pirate movies.

829
00:53:51,082 --> 00:53:52,404
We gotta work
as a team, okay?

830
00:53:52,405 --> 00:53:54,326
- Okay
- Okay, come on.

831
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,493
Call Mom. Tell her we're
gonna be 5 minutes late.

832
00:54:01,956 --> 00:54:04,355
- Noah.
- I need to talk to Mom.

833
00:54:04,356 --> 00:54:06,572
- It's Lilly.
- Sweety, where are you?

834
00:54:06,765 --> 00:54:09,295
- Hi Mommy
- Let me speak to Daddy

835
00:54:09,433 --> 00:54:12,202
He cant talk right now.
He's driving really fast.

836
00:54:13,563 --> 00:54:16,713
- Ouch!
- Lilly?

837
00:54:16,714 --> 00:54:18,537
Who is that? Who's
speaking in the car?

838
00:54:18,538 --> 00:54:19,912
He's not in the car,
he's on a mountain

839
00:54:19,913 --> 00:54:21,353
waiting for fireworks.

840
00:54:21,786 --> 00:54:23,291
Fireworks?
What fireworks?

841
00:54:23,292 --> 00:54:25,113
Daddy, over there.

842
00:54:27,445 --> 00:54:28,806
Good job, Lilly.

843
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,165
Let me talk
to mom now.

844
00:54:32,262 --> 00:54:35,768
- Hey! We got him.
- Bring back my child!

845
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:41,379
You stay here.

846
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,774
I will go talk to
the pirate, okay?

847
00:54:52,051 --> 00:54:53,107
Charlie!

848
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,759
Charlie!

849
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,446
What are you doing?
I thought you were toast.

850
00:54:58,481 --> 00:55:00,184
No no no! Where are
the space ships?

851
00:55:00,405 --> 00:55:02,272
No way you can
make it there.

852
00:55:02,288 --> 00:55:03,769
We have a plane.
You can come with us.

853
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:05,606
But we gotta leave
right now!

854
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:16,366
Fly birdies!

855
00:55:18,499 --> 00:55:19,682
Is this your kid?

856
00:55:20,945 --> 00:55:22,653
Where's the
god damn map?

857
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:25,955
Where's the map?

858
00:55:27,194 --> 00:55:29,393
- It's in the camper.
- Where in the camper?

859
00:55:29,421 --> 00:55:32,560
Map section. On the
conspiracy shelf.

860
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:33,520
Dewey Decimal System.

861
00:55:34,257 --> 00:55:36,954
Between Roswell...

862
00:55:37,051 --> 00:55:40,217
and Marilyn Monroe?

863
00:55:48,147 --> 00:55:49,813
It's starting.

864
00:55:57,682 --> 00:55:59,793
You sure you don't
wanna come with me?

865
00:56:00,189 --> 00:56:03,656
So beautiful,
I'm gonna stay.

866
00:56:04,453 --> 00:56:05,753
Good luck.

867
00:56:08,825 --> 00:56:10,510
This marks

868
00:56:10,511 --> 00:56:15,177
The last day of the
United States of America

869
00:56:15,447 --> 00:56:20,627
Final hour of all mankind.
As we will be visible from

870
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:24,481
the Milky Way as a tiny
little puff of smoke.

871
00:56:24,735 --> 00:56:29,268
I'm watching the Earth
crumble before my eyes.

872
00:56:30,133 --> 00:56:32,387
The giant ash cloud

873
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:35,252
created by this
super volcano

874
00:56:35,253 --> 00:56:38,123
will first envelop Vegas,

875
00:56:38,124 --> 00:56:39,881
and then St. Louis

876
00:56:39,971 --> 00:56:41,711
and then Chicago,

877
00:56:41,808 --> 00:56:44,099
and then at long last,

878
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:48,509
Washington D.C. will
have its lights go out.

879
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:50,259
That guy is crazy,
right Daddy?

880
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,614
Don't think so.

881
00:56:54,217 --> 00:56:55,934
This is ridiculous.

882
00:56:56,017 --> 00:56:57,583
It's been over
half an hour.

883
00:56:57,669 --> 00:56:59,929
- The guy is a nut job.
- Stop it.

884
00:57:00,141 --> 00:57:01,850
Noah, give me
the phone again.

885
00:57:23,098 --> 00:57:25,832
Daddy. What was that?

886
00:57:26,094 --> 00:57:28,409
Nothing. Nothing.

887
00:57:28,794 --> 00:57:31,769
I have goosebumps,
people!

888
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:55,648
I wish you could see
what I'm seeing, people.

889
00:57:55,649 --> 00:57:58,623
I wish you could be
here with me!

890
00:57:58,912 --> 00:58:00,735
Oh, baby!

891
00:58:02,088 --> 00:58:04,288
Bring it on!

892
00:58:04,289 --> 00:58:06,595
Always remember folks:

893
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:11,679
You heard it first
from Charlie!

894
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:28,042
Daddy, it's following us!

895
00:58:28,072 --> 00:58:29,109
Get down on the
ground and hold on.

896
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,940
Don't look back.
Just look at me.

897
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:34,195
- Do I look scared?
- Uhum.

898
00:58:38,186 --> 00:58:40,960
Hold on baby.
Hold on tight.

899
00:58:47,062 --> 00:58:48,947
Daddy, we're on fire!

900
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,492
There they are!

901
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:07,925
It's them.
It's them!

902
00:59:08,794 --> 00:59:10,744
Mommy!

903
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:15,289
Shit.

904
00:59:20,754 --> 00:59:24,068
Hang on baby.
Hang on

905
00:59:37,145 --> 00:59:40,148
Mommy.

906
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,560
- Lil, grab my hand.
- Come on, Noah.

907
00:59:48,575 --> 00:59:49,711
Lilly, you okay?

908
00:59:53,911 --> 00:59:57,240
Everybody on? Ready?
- Jackson!

909
00:59:59,515 --> 01:00:01,774
Where is he?
What's he doing?

910
01:00:05,272 --> 01:00:06,237
No!

911
01:00:14,635 --> 01:00:17,850
- Daddy!
- No!

912
01:00:21,011 --> 01:00:23,120
Hey. We have to go.

913
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:24,463
No, we're not
going anywhere!

914
01:00:24,464 --> 01:00:25,670
Kids, buckle up.
We're leaving.

915
01:00:25,671 --> 01:00:28,610
He's my dad.
We're gonna wait!

916
01:00:32,948 --> 01:00:34,402
No!

917
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:36,830
Daddy!

918
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:44,279
Wait! Wait. Roland,
I see something.

919
01:00:48,428 --> 01:00:51,135
It's Daddy!

920
01:00:53,897 --> 01:00:55,570
Slow down!

921
01:00:55,591 --> 01:00:57,243
Jackson, come on!

922
01:01:00,431 --> 01:01:01,529
Grab!

923
01:01:02,662 --> 01:01:04,076
We're running out
of runway.

924
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,036
For God's sakes, Kate,
pull him up.

925
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,829
Reach for my hand!

926
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:11,242
- Come on!
- Daddy!

927
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:17,328
Right. Here we go!

928
01:01:18,219 --> 01:01:20,517
Faster. Faster.

929
01:01:38,591 --> 01:01:40,310
Hang on

930
01:01:42,376 --> 01:01:45,761
- Go faster!
- I'm trying!

931
01:02:01,148 --> 01:02:05,702
Okay. We're good.
We're good.

932
01:02:09,248 --> 01:02:11,646
So. Now that you
got your map,

933
01:02:11,647 --> 01:02:13,194
where are we going?

934
01:02:18,584 --> 01:02:20,701
CHINA

935
01:02:23,112 --> 01:02:26,462
We're gonna need
a bigger plane.

936
01:02:32,156 --> 01:02:34,932
You just said that, Mom.
You just said that.

937
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:36,993
You don't remember that
you just said that?

938
01:02:37,008 --> 01:02:39,995
That's okay.

939
01:02:40,013 --> 01:02:44,492
Listen, Mom. I'll call you
next week, same time.

940
01:02:44,513 --> 01:02:49,544
Okay? Take care now.
Take care of yourself.

941
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:56,247
Sir. I think you
need to see this.

942
01:03:00,732 --> 01:03:03,643
I thought they'd give
you an extra ticket, Sir.

943
01:03:03,644 --> 01:03:04,603
They did.

944
01:03:04,862 --> 01:03:09,081
But my mother is almost 89.
She's in a wheelchair.

945
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:11,627
And she is easily confused.
And I am confident

946
01:03:11,656 --> 01:03:13,275
that she'll want to
meet her maker

947
01:03:13,276 --> 01:03:16,291
- on her own terms. Okay?
- Yes, sir.

948
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:18,542
- Who are you bringing?
- Nobody.

949
01:03:18,847 --> 01:03:21,868
My ex-wife said she never
wanted to see me again.

950
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:22,991
So be it.

951
01:03:22,992 --> 01:03:25,110
We could bring people
that contribute.

952
01:03:26,271 --> 01:03:28,930
<i>...has been damaged by a
series of major earthquakes.</i>

953
01:03:28,957 --> 01:03:32,382
<i>The death toll is expected to be
well over 2 million people.</i>

954
01:03:32,413 --> 01:03:35,635
<i>The devastation in Rio de Janeiro
is beyond imagination.</i>

955
01:03:35,672 --> 01:03:41,088
<i>Two 8.5 tremors have left the people
in the street fighting for resources.</i>

956
01:03:41,124 --> 01:03:45,237
<i>In the last hour we received this
video from Globo News, Brazil.</i>

957
01:03:45,741 --> 01:03:48,405
<i>What's happening? My God!</i>

958
01:03:48,426 --> 01:03:51,758
<i>The statue of Christ is collapsing!</i>

959
01:03:51,782 --> 01:03:53,918
<i>Fear and chaos have spread
throughout the globe.</i>

960
01:03:53,953 --> 01:03:57,625
<i>As in London, where the 30th
Olympic Games has been suspended.</i>

961
01:03:57,654 --> 01:04:00,057
<i>Hundreds of thousands are marching
towards 10 Downing Street</i>

962
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:03,458
<i>demanding a lift of the information
blackout proposed by the Prime Minister.</i>

963
01:04:03,497 --> 01:04:05,892
Thousands of calls to the switchboard.
We had to shut it down.

964
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:08,513
<i>We're receiving reports
from all across the globe.</i>

965
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:12,917
<i>Millions of distraught masses are
gathering in public places everywhere,</i>

966
01:04:12,918 --> 01:04:14,393
<i>converging in
desperate prayer.</i>

967
01:04:14,394 --> 01:04:17,665
<i>Preachers of many faiths
have taken their message of</i>

968
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:20,151
<i>the end of the world to
the streets all over the U.S.</i>

969
01:04:20,152 --> 01:04:22,427
<i>Repent.
There is still time.</i>

970
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,574
Kind of gaulling when
you realize the nutbags

971
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,648
with the cardboard signs
had it right the whole time.

972
01:04:26,649 --> 01:04:29,008
All these people
out there, sir.

973
01:04:29,009 --> 01:04:30,545
Shouldn't we be issuing
warnings now?

974
01:04:30,546 --> 01:04:32,770
Only when the boarding
process is complete.

975
01:04:32,771 --> 01:04:33,583
That's the plan.

976
01:04:33,584 --> 01:04:36,300
British Columbia
2010, remember?

977
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,751
Sir, those plans were
drawn up 2 years ago.

978
01:04:38,754 --> 01:04:44,263
Okay, everybody out.
Come on, get out.

979
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:46,380
Wasn't it also decided that
people have the right to

980
01:04:46,381 --> 01:04:48,487
fight for their lives,
best way they can?

981
01:04:48,488 --> 01:04:50,928
After we get everyone
on board, Adrian.

982
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,713
I think that's wrong.

983
01:04:53,171 --> 01:04:56,208
Want to tell everyone
they're doomed?

984
01:04:56,243 --> 01:04:57,728
There'd be anarchy.

985
01:04:57,761 --> 01:05:00,072
You want to jeopardize the
departure of the president?

986
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:05,531
Our mission is to assure the
continuity of our species.

987
01:05:05,576 --> 01:05:08,789
My question:
Can I count on you?

988
01:05:08,837 --> 01:05:10,999
Can I?

989
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,228
What?

990
01:05:12,229 --> 01:05:14,217
The Yellowstone Caldera
has erupted, sir.

991
01:05:14,218 --> 01:05:17,849
The ash cloud will reach
Washington in 7 hours.

992
01:05:18,194 --> 01:05:20,872
We've got to get away.

993
01:05:21,233 --> 01:05:22,506
Where is the
president, Sally?

994
01:05:22,507 --> 01:05:24,238
Said he wanted to spend
some time alone.

995
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:27,058
- I think he's at the chapel.
- He's going to church now?

996
01:05:27,076 --> 01:05:32,569
He's praying, sir. Which is
not such a bad idea.

997
01:05:34,145 --> 01:05:36,391
Mr. President. I need
to get you on

998
01:05:36,392 --> 01:05:38,980
Air Force One
immediately.

999
01:05:40,531 --> 01:05:41,784
Give me a moment
with Adrian.

1000
01:05:41,793 --> 01:05:43,997
No disrespect sir, we
do not have time.

1001
01:05:44,021 --> 01:05:47,329
Make time.

1002
01:05:57,310 --> 01:06:00,411
Did you ever meet
my wife: Dorothy?

1003
01:06:00,454 --> 01:06:04,236
No sir, I never had
that honor.

1004
01:06:04,324 --> 01:06:08,080
She was in and out
towards the end

1005
01:06:08,086 --> 01:06:10,235
The night before she
passed on, she took

1006
01:06:10,236 --> 01:06:12,083
my hand and told me:

1007
01:06:12,084 --> 01:06:16,455
"I think you should
have a lottery"

1008
01:06:16,491 --> 01:06:21,373
"Everyone should have
a chance to go"

1009
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:26,512
Maybe that's what we
should have done.

1010
01:06:27,376 --> 01:06:32,303
I'll be the last president of
the United States of America.

1011
01:06:32,346 --> 01:06:35,222
Do you know how
that feels, son?

1012
01:06:35,381 --> 01:06:39,327
No one could have saved
the country, sir.

1013
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:44,560
And I think, I think people
have a right to know.

1014
01:06:44,733 --> 01:06:48,255
Don't worry, I'll
take care of that.

1015
01:06:48,789 --> 01:06:51,738
Go on now.

1016
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,235
Not without you, sir.

1017
01:06:56,002 --> 01:06:58,145
Get on that plane, son.

1018
01:06:58,161 --> 01:07:01,527
It's a brave new world
you head into

1019
01:07:01,546 --> 01:07:07,123
And a young scientist will
be worth 20 old politicians.

1020
01:07:24,216 --> 01:07:26,516
We should go to my parents
house in the Rockies.

1021
01:07:26,517 --> 01:07:29,382
This isn't one of your crazy
stories, now. Right, Jackson?

1022
01:07:29,383 --> 01:07:30,658
How the hell are we going
to make it to China?

1023
01:07:30,659 --> 01:07:31,692
Hey, Gordon.

1024
01:07:31,693 --> 01:07:33,876
Without Jackson we wouldn't
have made it out of California.

1025
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:36,266
Noah, please.

1026
01:07:43,451 --> 01:07:45,351
Be careful with
the landing gear!

1027
01:07:45,371 --> 01:07:47,504
Easy gringo, I know
what I'm doing.

1028
01:07:47,505 --> 01:07:48,475
<i>Attention!</i>

1029
01:07:48,476 --> 01:07:50,484
<i>The National Guard
has informed us that an</i>

1030
01:07:50,485 --> 01:07:52,581
<i>extremely hazardous
ash cloud is headed for</i>

1031
01:07:52,582 --> 01:07:53,638
<i>the city of Las Vegas.</i>

1032
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:55,348
Where are you going?

1033
01:07:57,427 --> 01:07:58,849
Move! You can't
stay here.

1034
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:01,320
- I have a plane here.
- It's not safe.

1035
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:15,113
So you got positive
confirmation on this?

1036
01:08:15,419 --> 01:08:18,336
Thank you,
I understand.

1037
01:08:27,378 --> 01:08:30,344
The President
is not coming.

1038
01:08:34,053 --> 01:08:39,809
So, the Captain won't
abandon his sinking ship.

1039
01:08:40,026 --> 01:08:43,423
That's his choice,
and a noble one.

1040
01:08:43,446 --> 01:08:45,242
I have also
just learned

1041
01:08:45,243 --> 01:08:47,398
that the Vice
President's chopper

1042
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:50,823
went down in the ash
cloud outside Pittsburgh.

1043
01:08:51,032 --> 01:08:54,896
Fortunately, we have
protocols to follow.

1044
01:08:54,914 --> 01:08:56,285
What about the Speaker
of the House?

1045
01:08:56,286 --> 01:08:57,902
In this chaos, I have
no idea. Where is he?

1046
01:08:57,903 --> 01:08:59,489
He's the Commander
in Chief now, sir.

1047
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:03,097
This is one flight he
shouldn't be late for.

1048
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:04,400
Tell the Captain
we're taking off.

1049
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:06,212
Sir, you don't have
the authority.

1050
01:09:06,213 --> 01:09:08,399
Who got the authority?
You? You got the authority?

1051
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,268
You couldn't even keep
your damn mouth shut.

1052
01:09:10,269 --> 01:09:12,714
You betrayed top secret
information.

1053
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:13,884
What the hell are
you talking about?

1054
01:09:13,885 --> 01:09:15,429
You told your father
everything,

1055
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:16,889
put this entire
plan in jeopardy,

1056
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:18,362
Good thing for you
the old man could

1057
01:09:18,397 --> 01:09:19,835
keep his mouth shut
better than you.

1058
01:09:19,836 --> 01:09:21,367
Don't look so shocked.

1059
01:09:21,368 --> 01:09:22,844
We had to monitor
everybody who knew,

1060
01:09:22,845 --> 01:09:24,655
How do you think we kept
it a secret for so long?

1061
01:09:24,656 --> 01:09:27,258
So you just killed anybody
who tried to talk?

1062
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:29,836
Anybody who tried to talk
was not just an enemy

1063
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:31,758
of the state. They were
an enemy of humanity.

1064
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,987
The director of the Louvre
was an enemy of humanity?

1065
01:09:33,988 --> 01:09:36,665
After he called a press
conference he was.

1066
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,151
Jesus, what did
you think?

1067
01:09:39,152 --> 01:09:40,323
We're all just gonna
get on board,

1068
01:09:40,324 --> 01:09:42,338
hold hands and
sing Kumbaya?

1069
01:09:43,197 --> 01:09:46,352
Sit down and
buckle up.

1070
01:09:54,203 --> 01:09:57,105
Excuse me, is my father
in the Command Center?

1071
01:09:57,128 --> 01:10:00,125
President is on
the line, Dr Wilson.

1072
01:10:00,558 --> 01:10:03,134
Thank you.

1073
01:10:08,414 --> 01:10:09,667
Where are you?

1074
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:14,017
You never would've gotten
on that plane if I told you.

1075
01:10:15,423 --> 01:10:17,467
But you said that
you'd be here

1076
01:10:17,468 --> 01:10:19,019
Darling, listen to me.

1077
01:10:19,033 --> 01:10:21,799
Do you understand how
much strength it gives me

1078
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,346
knowing that you
will survive?

1079
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:28,443
The only thing left
to do now,

1080
01:10:28,464 --> 01:10:31,612
is tell the truth
to people.

1081
01:10:31,647 --> 01:10:36,235
At least if they know,

1082
01:10:36,236 --> 01:10:40,074
families can say
goodbye to each other.

1083
01:10:40,109 --> 01:10:44,275
A mother can comfort
her children.

1084
01:10:45,322 --> 01:10:49,157
And a father...

1085
01:10:49,158 --> 01:10:52,656
can ask his daughter
for forgiveness.

1086
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:03,857
Whenever you're ready,
Mr President.

1087
01:11:10,702 --> 01:11:13,469
My fellow Americans

1088
01:11:13,698 --> 01:11:17,340
This will be the last
time I address you.

1089
01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:22,984
As you know, catastrophe
has struck our nation.

1090
01:11:23,867 --> 01:11:26,267
Has struck the world.

1091
01:11:26,268 --> 01:11:28,437
I wish I could tell you

1092
01:11:28,438 --> 01:11:31,679
we could prevent
the coming destruction.

1093
01:11:31,695 --> 01:11:33,492
We cannot.

1094
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,376
Today, none of us
are strangers.

1095
01:11:37,619 --> 01:11:40,849
Today, we are
one family,

1096
01:11:40,867 --> 01:11:44,179
stepping into the
darkness together.

1097
01:11:44,202 --> 01:11:47,243
We are a nation of
many religions,

1098
01:11:47,268 --> 01:11:51,135
but I believe these
words reflect the spirit

1099
01:11:51,136 --> 01:11:53,412
of all our faiths:

1100
01:11:53,662 --> 01:11:56,488
"The lord is my
Shepard. I shall... "

1101
01:11:58,307 --> 01:12:01,641
People! Get away from
the doors and windows.

1102
01:12:01,881 --> 01:12:04,282
What are we gonna do?
You tell me.

1103
01:12:04,317 --> 01:12:07,125
- Dr Silberman?
- Tamara!

1104
01:12:07,126 --> 01:12:09,343
What are you
doing here?

1105
01:12:09,344 --> 01:12:10,611
She's a patient,
Honey.

1106
01:12:10,629 --> 01:12:14,078
Excuse me, I have a
private plane out there.

1107
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:17,196
Karpov! Yuri!

1108
01:12:17,197 --> 01:12:19,349
You knew. This whole
time you knew.

1109
01:12:19,384 --> 01:12:21,822
You've got a way out of here,
right? You got a plane?

1110
01:12:21,845 --> 01:12:24,350
My family, take us
with you. Please!

1111
01:12:24,369 --> 01:12:26,638
Boss, boss.

1112
01:12:26,639 --> 01:12:28,409
I found us a plane.
An Antonov.

1113
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:29,668
They were just
about to take off,

1114
01:12:29,669 --> 01:12:31,147
but the tower
didn't let them.

1115
01:12:31,148 --> 01:12:34,287
Can you still fly
that thing?

1116
01:12:34,322 --> 01:12:37,426
Sure, Boss, but
I need co-pilot.

1117
01:12:37,447 --> 01:12:40,256
Gordon's a pilot.

1118
01:12:40,257 --> 01:12:42,071
No, I'm not.

1119
01:12:42,072 --> 01:12:44,741
Yes he is. Great pilot.
Let's go.

1120
01:12:44,756 --> 01:12:47,429
Good. Let's go!

1121
01:12:47,455 --> 01:12:51,507
Jackson, stop
saying I'm a pilot.

1122
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:54,640
You can't go out there.
Come back!

1123
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:01,194
Move back, people!

1124
01:13:06,646 --> 01:13:09,162
Wow, that's
a big plane.

1125
01:13:09,558 --> 01:13:12,085
It's Russian.

1126
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:14,144
Let's move everybody.
Come on!

1127
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:21,457
- Gordon, where are you?
- Let's go!

1128
01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:24,664
Up here, Gordon.
Hurry up!

1129
01:13:24,852 --> 01:13:27,395
Oh my God.

1130
01:13:34,351 --> 01:13:37,831
- Woah, look at these.
- Las Vegas auto show.

1131
01:13:37,841 --> 01:13:40,954
We had VIP tickets
for this.

1132
01:13:40,975 --> 01:13:42,279
That's fantastic, let's go.

1133
01:13:42,308 --> 01:13:44,134
Check the main bus
for hydraulics,

1134
01:13:44,135 --> 01:13:45,287
I'll balance the tanks.

1135
01:13:45,322 --> 01:13:47,388
What?

1136
01:13:47,879 --> 01:13:50,047
Okay, okay.
I'm trying.

1137
01:13:52,135 --> 01:13:54,126
Tower to Antonov, what
the hell are you doing?

1138
01:13:54,127 --> 01:13:55,086
Shut down immediately.

1139
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:03,898
- Caesar, shh.

1140
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:05,481
When I say "go"

1141
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:07,377
we push all this down
at once, okay?

1142
01:14:07,397 --> 01:14:08,938
- Okay.
- Go!

1143
01:14:08,971 --> 01:14:12,987
Antonov, abort take-off.
You do not have clearance.

1144
01:14:13,025 --> 01:14:16,571
I repeat, you
must abort.

1145
01:14:21,532 --> 01:14:22,676
What the hell
was that?

1146
01:14:22,677 --> 01:14:25,067
I don't know, but
it's not good.

1147
01:14:27,185 --> 01:14:30,319
- Push!
- Pushing! Come on!

1148
01:14:33,414 --> 01:14:35,840
We're going down!

1149
01:14:44,052 --> 01:14:46,331
It must be the...
Take over.

1150
01:14:46,365 --> 01:14:49,178
What do you mean,
take over?

1151
01:14:50,852 --> 01:14:52,864
- Sasha!
- Relax.

1152
01:14:52,894 --> 01:14:54,514
Now!

1153
01:14:58,948 --> 01:14:59,808
Jesus.

1154
01:15:02,721 --> 01:15:04,422
- Oh God
- I think I got it

1155
01:15:04,454 --> 01:15:07,316
- Sasha, now!
- Take a deep breath.

1156
01:15:07,912 --> 01:15:09,302
Pull!

1157
01:15:34,894 --> 01:15:37,332
Was that the Eiffel Tower?

1158
01:15:37,473 --> 01:15:41,165
I think so.

1159
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:51,999
Ladies and Gentlemen.
We're on our way to China.

1160
01:15:52,318 --> 01:15:57,325
Good. Very good.

1161
01:16:04,752 --> 01:16:06,868
Do not believe in
something simply

1162
01:16:06,869 --> 01:16:09,892
because you have
heard it, Nima.

1163
01:16:09,893 --> 01:16:13,605
But great Lama.
Tenzin is my brother.

1164
01:16:13,661 --> 01:16:15,090
He works inside
the big tunnel,

1165
01:16:15,091 --> 01:16:16,932
where the ships
are built.

1166
01:16:19,328 --> 01:16:22,154
But what is there
in your wisdom,

1167
01:16:22,155 --> 01:16:24,480
great Lama,
if Tenzin is right?

1168
01:16:24,481 --> 01:16:28,687
What if our world is
indeed coming to and end?

1169
01:16:36,453 --> 01:16:39,855
It is full, great Rinpoche.

1170
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:46,414
Like this cup,

1171
01:16:46,457 --> 01:16:52,214
you are full of opinions and
speculations.

1172
01:16:52,577 --> 01:16:54,561
To see the light
of wisdom,

1173
01:16:54,602 --> 01:16:58,772
You first must
empty your cup.

1174
01:17:14,107 --> 01:17:16,000
Be careful with
the clutch...

1175
01:17:16,361 --> 01:17:18,669
It tends to slip.

1176
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:39,304
Grandpa, Nima is here!

1177
01:17:39,337 --> 01:17:41,093
Grandma, I got a message
from Tenzin...

1178
01:17:41,127 --> 01:17:43,098
He want us to meet
him in Cho Ming

1179
01:17:43,099 --> 01:17:44,058
at the work camp.

1180
01:17:45,443 --> 01:17:48,044
He says he can get us onto
the ships he's working on.

1181
01:17:48,045 --> 01:17:49,866
What are you
talking about?

1182
01:17:49,867 --> 01:17:52,346
Tenzin works
on the dam.

1183
01:17:54,842 --> 01:17:56,222
Grandma...

1184
01:17:56,867 --> 01:18:00,166
...the dam is a ship.
The government lied to us.

1185
01:18:00,863 --> 01:18:02,723
There will be a big flood!

1186
01:18:03,372 --> 01:18:04,993
We must pack up
right away.

1187
01:18:05,159 --> 01:18:07,927
Nima? Who gave
you a truck?

1188
01:18:08,621 --> 01:18:11,774
We took a trip on the
Liam Song ferry once

1189
01:18:11,898 --> 01:18:14,522
Grandpa threw up
the whole way.

1190
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:17,346
Let's eat first.

1191
01:18:21,962 --> 01:18:25,482
Hey, look, the new Bentley!
Our father had one on order.

1192
01:18:25,903 --> 01:18:27,814
He was supposed to
get it next year.

1193
01:18:27,815 --> 01:18:30,641
But then he canceled it.
Because of the ships.

1194
01:18:31,314 --> 01:18:33,360
How many cars does
your family have?

1195
01:18:33,394 --> 01:18:36,376
My mom's boyfriend
has a Porsche.

1196
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,531
Our parents are
divorced too.

1197
01:18:41,709 --> 01:18:43,282
Found a hat.

1198
01:18:43,574 --> 01:18:45,597
She has a thing
for hats.

1199
01:18:45,598 --> 01:18:47,874
I was just like
that at her age.

1200
01:18:48,261 --> 01:18:50,157
They made me
feel safe.

1201
01:18:50,766 --> 01:18:54,069
So, how did you meet
Dr Silberman?

1202
01:18:55,062 --> 01:18:57,400
As you can see not the
same way you did.

1203
01:18:58,906 --> 01:19:02,560
My boyfriend asked me
to get them done

1204
01:19:02,702 --> 01:19:04,528
But he's not
your husband?

1205
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:06,492
We are not married.

1206
01:19:06,493 --> 01:19:08,624
And probably
never will be.

1207
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:17,625
For the boys.

1208
01:19:21,471 --> 01:19:24,827
They seem to like
each other.

1209
01:19:26,367 --> 01:19:27,932
Yeah, I guess.

1210
01:19:29,158 --> 01:19:32,129
Tell me, Mr Karpov,
how much did you pay?

1211
01:19:32,207 --> 01:19:36,601
One billion Euro.
Per seat.

1212
01:19:37,984 --> 01:19:40,582
That's disgusting
- Oh yeah?

1213
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:45,357
You know, Curtis, I wasn't
always a businessman.

1214
01:19:45,466 --> 01:19:47,651
I am a boxer.

1215
01:19:47,652 --> 01:19:49,662
Was my only playing
when I was boy

1216
01:19:49,663 --> 01:19:52,646
back in Murmansk.
And my coach,

1217
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:57,451
his name was also Yuri.
He always said:

1218
01:19:57,486 --> 01:20:00,935
"If someone wants
to beat you...

1219
01:20:00,936 --> 01:20:03,708
...he has to
kill you first"

1220
01:20:06,682 --> 01:20:09,650
That's very nice.

1221
01:20:10,115 --> 01:20:12,705
But tell me, what
would you have done

1222
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:15,593
if you were rich
like me?

1223
01:20:15,594 --> 01:20:18,728
Look, they are
wonderful children.

1224
01:20:20,123 --> 01:20:23,313
OK guys. The plan is
to refill in Hawaii,

1225
01:20:23,314 --> 01:20:25,460
so sit down and
buckle up.

1226
01:20:25,461 --> 01:20:28,589
Gordon and I
will do the rest.

1227
01:20:29,933 --> 01:20:31,558
Oh God.

1228
01:20:32,966 --> 01:20:34,773
Go get the guys.

1229
01:20:37,172 --> 01:20:42,353
Guys, there's a...
You might wanna...

1230
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:02,601
- What is that?
- The state of Hawaii

1231
01:21:03,023 --> 01:21:06,983
Not good. That is
not good.

1232
01:21:11,594 --> 01:21:13,379
How much fuel do
we have left?

1233
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:14,514
Not enough.

1234
01:21:14,515 --> 01:21:16,734
We have to make a
water landing

1235
01:21:16,735 --> 01:21:18,631
Somewhere in
South China sea.

1236
01:21:18,744 --> 01:21:21,773
Great, at least we won't
need a landing gear.

1237
01:21:21,808 --> 01:21:24,803
- What about it?
- We lost it all, in Vegas.

1238
01:21:34,871 --> 01:21:36,924
Dr Wilson,
may I come in?

1239
01:21:37,481 --> 01:21:39,850
I'm not very good
company, I'm afraid.

1240
01:21:40,817 --> 01:21:43,823
- Doctor...
- Please, call me Adrian.

1241
01:21:49,157 --> 01:21:51,585
All those people
we left behind.

1242
01:21:51,952 --> 01:21:54,649
They don't stand
a chance, do they?

1243
01:21:55,798 --> 01:21:58,661
I believe that nature
will choose for itself,

1244
01:21:58,662 --> 01:22:01,746
from itself, what
will survive.

1245
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:06,228
Just like you, preserving
those great artworks.

1246
01:22:06,362 --> 01:22:08,900
Our culture is our
soul, and that's not

1247
01:22:08,901 --> 01:22:10,388
dying tonight.

1248
01:22:10,389 --> 01:22:14,576
Come on, I contributed
to this cover up.

1249
01:22:14,577 --> 01:22:17,853
The Da Vinci, Picasso,
they're in.

1250
01:22:17,854 --> 01:22:21,036
But if you're some nobody
you don't stand a chance.

1251
01:22:21,711 --> 01:22:24,041
It's not necessarily true.

1252
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:28,549
Did you ever hear of a writer
called Jackson Curtis?

1253
01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:31,652
Wrote a book,
"Farewell Atlantis".

1254
01:22:31,653 --> 01:22:32,994
What do you think the
chances are of an

1255
01:22:32,995 --> 01:22:35,938
unknown writer who
barely sold 500 copies

1256
01:22:35,939 --> 01:22:38,063
making it aboard
this plane?

1257
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:41,565
- I don't understand
- I mean call it chance

1258
01:22:41,566 --> 01:22:44,223
or faith or nature,
doesn't matter

1259
01:22:44,224 --> 01:22:48,121
This book is part of our
legacy now. Why?

1260
01:22:48,214 --> 01:22:49,998
Because I'm reading it.

1261
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:56,746
Dr Helmsley, please report
to the situation room.

1262
01:23:08,982 --> 01:23:10,110
Who is it?

1263
01:23:10,111 --> 01:23:12,983
<i>- Hello, I'm sorry.
Who is this?</i>

1264
01:23:13,191 --> 01:23:15,253
This is Yoko Delgado.

1265
01:23:15,254 --> 01:23:17,903
Do you want to
speak to my daddy?

1266
01:23:20,326 --> 01:23:21,730
Yes, please.

1267
01:23:21,731 --> 01:23:24,199
<i>Who should I
say is calling?</i>

1268
01:23:27,264 --> 01:23:32,468
- Tell him, its his father.
- You're my grandpa?

1269
01:23:32,842 --> 01:23:35,013
Yes, sweetheart, I am.

1270
01:23:37,062 --> 01:23:40,275
Daddy, grandpa
is on the phone.

1271
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,455
Mr President, Sir.

1272
01:24:49,267 --> 01:24:52,498
- What's the matter, sweety?
- She can't find her daddy.

1273
01:24:54,057 --> 01:24:58,992
Why don't you two get
comfy on that couch?

1274
01:25:00,391 --> 01:25:02,499
I'll find your daddy.

1275
01:25:09,588 --> 01:25:11,435
Who can help me with
missing persons?

1276
01:25:11,436 --> 01:25:14,731
Sorry, man, I'm really
busy right now.

1277
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:18,358
I mean of course, sir.
Sorry, Mr President.

1278
01:25:18,359 --> 01:25:21,359
- Don't worry about it, you're
doing a great job, son.

1279
01:25:45,938 --> 01:25:46,828
What's happening?

1280
01:25:46,829 --> 01:25:48,376
The Capitol has
been hit by a 9.4

1281
01:25:48,377 --> 01:25:49,871
Lost communication with
the White House, sir.

1282
01:25:49,872 --> 01:25:52,731
- Where is it centered?
- North Chesapeake Bay.

1283
01:25:56,311 --> 01:25:59,600
Mr Anheuser, Russian
president on the line, sir.

1284
01:25:59,862 --> 01:26:01,050
Excuse me.

1285
01:26:01,872 --> 01:26:03,901
We just entered
Chinese air space.

1286
01:26:05,438 --> 01:26:07,436
That's affirmative,
Mr President.

1287
01:26:07,437 --> 01:26:10,604
Until communication
is restored,

1288
01:26:10,605 --> 01:26:12,217
I suppose I am
in command.

1289
01:26:12,783 --> 01:26:14,261
It appears that all
other heads of state

1290
01:26:14,262 --> 01:26:16,358
are en route, with the
exception of the

1291
01:26:16,359 --> 01:26:17,319
Italian Prime Minister,

1292
01:26:18,456 --> 01:26:20,983
Who has also
decided to

1293
01:26:21,018 --> 01:26:24,240
stay behind and
trust in prayer.

1294
01:27:26,728 --> 01:27:29,493
Earths crust has begun
to shift, Dr Helmsley!

1295
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:32,744
- By what degree?
- 1.2°. Still moving.

1296
01:27:32,827 --> 01:27:34,095
So, what happens next?

1297
01:27:34,096 --> 01:27:36,661
The movement of our land
masses comes to a halt.

1298
01:27:36,695 --> 01:27:38,116
Let's see a simulation.

1299
01:27:39,448 --> 01:27:41,361
Expect the formation
of gigantic tsunamis.

1300
01:27:41,362 --> 01:27:44,590
Proportional to the magnitude
of corresponding quakes.

1301
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:51,175
Pull up the Japanese
sea border.

1302
01:27:51,176 --> 01:27:52,136
Yes, sir.

1303
01:27:53,249 --> 01:27:55,607
My dad's on a cruise
ship out there.

1304
01:27:56,782 --> 01:27:59,207
But I guess you already
knew that.

1305
01:28:00,138 --> 01:28:02,054
Sir, we've recorded
two underwater quakes

1306
01:28:02,055 --> 01:28:04,413
at 7.9 and 8.2.

1307
01:28:20,786 --> 01:28:23,163
From what we have just
learned, Tokyo seems to

1308
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:25,541
have taken the full
force of the earthquake.

1309
01:28:25,542 --> 01:28:27,649
At this point unconfirmed
reports indicate that

1310
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:30,632
large areas of land
are under water.

1311
01:28:30,633 --> 01:28:32,056
Please stay tuned
for further...

1312
01:28:41,681 --> 01:28:43,372
Tony

1313
01:28:43,599 --> 01:28:46,181
I called.

1314
01:28:48,352 --> 01:28:50,857
I was too late.

1315
01:28:54,677 --> 01:28:58,258
Maybe they got
out of town.

1316
01:28:58,259 --> 01:28:59,650
You never know.

1317
01:30:23,776 --> 01:30:26,317
I'm coming home,
Dorothy.

1318
01:30:51,832 --> 01:30:53,218
Anything?

1319
01:30:54,126 --> 01:30:56,142
Nothing but static.

1320
01:30:56,143 --> 01:30:57,870
Not even an
emergency signal.

1321
01:31:09,794 --> 01:31:12,828
Can't think about what's
going on down there

1322
01:31:19,858 --> 01:31:21,798
Remember that old Beetle
we used to camp in?

1323
01:31:21,799 --> 01:31:23,430
But you'd never
get the roof up.

1324
01:31:24,615 --> 01:31:28,029
We definitely
traded up.

1325
01:31:30,201 --> 01:31:32,351
Tried to find our old
spot at Yellowstone.

1326
01:31:32,352 --> 01:31:35,032
When I went camping
with the kids, but...

1327
01:31:35,033 --> 01:31:36,885
I couldn't find it.

1328
01:31:46,139 --> 01:31:48,969
Do you think
people change?

1329
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:50,941
By people, do
you mean me?

1330
01:31:50,942 --> 01:31:51,610
Yes.

1331
01:31:51,611 --> 01:31:54,448
Do you think you've changed
since we separated?

1332
01:31:55,523 --> 01:31:58,097
I seem to eat a lot
more cereal now.

1333
01:32:02,162 --> 01:32:05,021
You always had
tunnel vision.

1334
01:32:05,022 --> 01:32:07,997
You could just block
everything out and write.

1335
01:32:11,389 --> 01:32:13,485
You blocked us out.

1336
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:23,456
Do you love him?

1337
01:32:26,178 --> 01:32:28,063
I love him enough.

1338
01:32:39,401 --> 01:32:42,669
All global ground communication
is ceased, sir.

1339
01:32:46,369 --> 01:32:51,137
The only signals our
satellites are picking up

1340
01:32:51,755 --> 01:32:54,298
Well there's a piece
of good news.

1341
01:32:54,299 --> 01:32:55,546
Any updates, Doctor?

1342
01:32:55,651 --> 01:32:59,078
We expect the tsunamis to reach
land fall on every continent.

1343
01:32:59,208 --> 01:33:00,882
The Cho Ming area will
be impacted in

1344
01:33:00,917 --> 01:33:02,610
approximately 6 hours.

1345
01:33:03,475 --> 01:33:05,936
It looks like the crust
have shifted by almost

1346
01:33:05,937 --> 01:33:08,178
23 degrees to
the southwest.

1347
01:33:08,839 --> 01:33:11,320
The data also shows
the Earth's poles

1348
01:33:11,321 --> 01:33:13,451
have reversed their
magnetic fields.

1349
01:33:13,452 --> 01:33:15,419
These are their
new positions.

1350
01:33:15,971 --> 01:33:20,894
You're telling me that
the North Pole

1351
01:33:20,895 --> 01:33:23,101
is now somewhere
in Wisconsin?

1352
01:33:23,102 --> 01:33:25,907
Actually, thats the
South Pole now.

1353
01:33:33,815 --> 01:33:36,182
Engine failure.
2 of 6 are down.

1354
01:33:36,183 --> 01:33:37,792
You must get ready.

1355
01:33:38,979 --> 01:33:42,316
- How long do we have?
- 18 minutes. Maybe.

1356
01:33:44,011 --> 01:33:45,585
Better wake
up the kids.

1357
01:33:45,586 --> 01:33:46,859
Da.

1358
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:26,325
Why do you
hate Gordon?

1359
01:34:30,854 --> 01:34:34,222
Hey. Come on.

1360
01:34:35,088 --> 01:34:39,247
What are you talking about?
I don't hate him.

1361
01:34:39,547 --> 01:34:41,073
You don't like him either

1362
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:44,147
That's because I don't
know him well, maybe.

1363
01:34:44,290 --> 01:34:45,568
But I do.

1364
01:34:45,569 --> 01:34:47,787
He's really nice once
you get to know him.

1365
01:34:47,822 --> 01:34:49,445
You should talk
to him more often.

1366
01:34:49,446 --> 01:34:52,099
You guys would get
along really well.

1367
01:34:55,179 --> 01:34:57,008
You like him a lot, huh?

1368
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:08,562
I'll do my best.
I promise. OK?

1369
01:35:09,866 --> 01:35:13,249
I'm really proud of you.
Really proud of you.

1370
01:35:14,704 --> 01:35:16,551
Is it time?

1371
01:35:18,276 --> 01:35:20,324
Yeah

1372
01:35:22,645 --> 01:35:23,976
Dad, what's wrong?

1373
01:35:24,361 --> 01:35:27,120
Sasha's gotta land.
It's gonna be a little bumpy.

1374
01:35:27,121 --> 01:35:28,368
Maybe a little wet.

1375
01:35:29,379 --> 01:35:30,378
Daddy?

1376
01:35:36,183 --> 01:35:38,287
Hold her steady.

1377
01:35:54,382 --> 01:35:58,230
Daddy, I'm not a
really good swimmer.

1378
01:35:58,231 --> 01:35:59,600
Hey, that's alright. It's
what you got this for.

1379
01:36:00,691 --> 01:36:03,165
It's like being in
a swimming pool.

1380
01:36:03,166 --> 01:36:06,791
Only it's got more cool stuff.
It's got a whistle, a light.

1381
01:36:07,942 --> 01:36:09,710
I thought we were
going to China.

1382
01:36:10,486 --> 01:36:12,506
No, we gotta
land here.

1383
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:16,695
So that's what
we're gonna do.

1384
01:36:16,696 --> 01:36:17,998
We're just gonna
all stay together.

1385
01:36:18,262 --> 01:36:19,498
No we're not,
we're gonna die!

1386
01:36:19,499 --> 01:36:21,537
No, we're not.

1387
01:36:21,665 --> 01:36:23,056
Promise?

1388
01:36:23,174 --> 01:36:24,910
I promise you, we'll
all stay together,

1389
01:36:24,911 --> 01:36:27,066
no matter what happens.

1390
01:36:41,267 --> 01:36:43,827
Jackson, Yuri.

1391
01:36:45,873 --> 01:36:47,288
I think you better
come up here

1392
01:36:48,401 --> 01:36:49,904
I'm gonna go check
this out.

1393
01:36:50,045 --> 01:36:51,020
- Dad, dad!
- I'll be right back

1394
01:36:51,897 --> 01:36:54,702
We gotta buckle
up. Let's go.

1395
01:36:55,913 --> 01:36:58,086
Don't ask me how
that happened

1396
01:36:58,878 --> 01:36:59,957
There is no more
ocean, and we're

1397
01:36:59,958 --> 01:37:01,898
pretty close to where
we wanted to go.

1398
01:37:01,899 --> 01:37:03,958
It's like the whole world
shifted by 1000 miles.

1399
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:06,672
1578 to be exact.

1400
01:37:06,673 --> 01:37:08,927
It's called "Earth Crust
Displacement Theory"

1401
01:37:08,928 --> 01:37:10,874
Professor Hapgood 1958.

1402
01:37:12,442 --> 01:37:13,656
Way to go, Charlie.

1403
01:37:16,772 --> 01:37:17,689
What was that?

1404
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:21,660
We just lost our
last two engines.

1405
01:37:39,538 --> 01:37:41,092
I'll shoot for that glacier.

1406
01:37:41,126 --> 01:37:42,380
It's going to
get rocky.

1407
01:37:42,414 --> 01:37:44,297
Listen, it's gonna
sound crazy,

1408
01:37:44,298 --> 01:37:46,397
but here's what
you have to do.

1409
01:37:50,358 --> 01:37:53,591
Get up! Follow me!

1410
01:37:53,835 --> 01:37:55,718
Yuri, what are you doing?

1411
01:37:56,177 --> 01:37:58,275
We are taking the Bentley!

1412
01:37:59,283 --> 01:38:01,727
Not yet!
Not yet.

1413
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:04,906
Almost there.

1414
01:38:05,884 --> 01:38:07,033
Get in the car.

1415
01:38:17,561 --> 01:38:19,925
Okay, go now!
Pull!

1416
01:38:24,668 --> 01:38:25,651
No no no no no

1417
01:38:30,137 --> 01:38:31,255
Go, Jackson.

1418
01:38:31,256 --> 01:38:33,060
We gotta wait
for Sasha and Gordon.

1419
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:35,914
Go! Make sure
everybody gets

1420
01:38:35,915 --> 01:38:37,924
off the plane before
I touch down.

1421
01:38:37,925 --> 01:38:39,083
What about you?

1422
01:38:39,117 --> 01:38:42,953
I'll be fine. I have to
touch this plane down.

1423
01:38:44,012 --> 01:38:46,632
What are you
waiting for? Go!

1424
01:39:02,191 --> 01:39:03,727
There he is.
I see him!

1425
01:39:04,001 --> 01:39:05,533
Come on lets go.

1426
01:39:05,534 --> 01:39:07,102
- Where is Sasha?
- He said he's fine

1427
01:39:07,103 --> 01:39:09,509
We should get out of here
before he touches down.

1428
01:39:09,543 --> 01:39:10,814
Don't go!

1429
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:13,695
Go Jackson, go.

1430
01:39:15,453 --> 01:39:16,542
It wont start.

1431
01:39:17,911 --> 01:39:20,551
Shut up everybody!

1432
01:39:21,889 --> 01:39:23,712
Engine

1433
01:39:23,713 --> 01:39:25,648
Start

1434
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:31,395
Voice control.
Sold me on it.

1435
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:31,717
Welcome, to the People's
Republic of China.

1436
01:41:31,718 --> 01:41:33,651
- Good to be here.
- Say hi, kids.

1437
01:41:33,685 --> 01:41:34,796
Hi

1438
01:41:34,829 --> 01:41:37,916
- What color are your passes?
- What?

1439
01:41:37,950 --> 01:41:40,035
What color are your
boarding passes?

1440
01:41:41,834 --> 01:41:44,190
I have green cards.

1441
01:41:44,769 --> 01:41:47,502
- For my boys and me.
- What?

1442
01:41:50,665 --> 01:41:52,561
Yuri? Yuri!

1443
01:41:53,397 --> 01:41:56,385
Yuri. It's a mistake.
A joke, eh?

1444
01:41:57,088 --> 01:42:02,182
What? You think I didn't know
about you and Sasha?

1445
01:42:02,215 --> 01:42:06,781
May God bless that poor
bastard's soul.

1446
01:42:11,669 --> 01:42:15,167
I'm sorry guys.
Good luck.

1447
01:42:15,510 --> 01:42:17,341
Come on, boys.

1448
01:42:18,744 --> 01:42:21,192
Maybe with money
we could bribe them.

1449
01:42:21,226 --> 01:42:22,993
You got a billion Euros?

1450
01:42:27,166 --> 01:42:31,691
Dr Wilson. I'm Captain Michaels,
Skipper of the American ship.

1451
01:42:31,725 --> 01:42:34,145
Please accept my sincere
condolences for your father.

1452
01:42:34,146 --> 01:42:35,490
Thank you, Captain.

1453
01:42:36,983 --> 01:42:40,146
Anheuser. Your party
is the last to arrive.

1454
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:46,338
There's been reports of
severe damage, Captain.

1455
01:42:46,339 --> 01:42:48,431
What's the status of
Ark number 3?

1456
01:42:48,432 --> 01:42:50,404
We haven't done a
complete assessment yet.

1457
01:42:50,405 --> 01:42:52,611
Looks like we lost it.

1458
01:43:01,476 --> 01:43:04,708
No toothbrush.
Only books.

1459
01:43:04,742 --> 01:43:08,217
When I was a kid my dad
was on the road a lot.

1460
01:43:09,205 --> 01:43:13,316
He'd always leave me
a box full of books.

1461
01:43:13,811 --> 01:43:17,216
I'd get an ice cream cone
for every book I read so...

1462
01:43:17,217 --> 01:43:19,000
I was a fat kid.

1463
01:43:19,281 --> 01:43:21,653
I find that very hard
to believe.

1464
01:43:21,654 --> 01:43:26,524
No, its true, my high school
carrier was 2000 books

1465
01:43:26,525 --> 01:43:28,178
Zero girlfriends.

1466
01:43:29,150 --> 01:43:32,464
I didn't even kiss a boy
until I was in college.

1467
01:43:32,465 --> 01:43:35,067
They were all too
scared of my dad.

1468
01:44:20,787 --> 01:44:22,085
Leave it to the Chinese.

1469
01:44:22,717 --> 01:44:24,118
I didn't think
it was possible.

1470
01:44:24,119 --> 01:44:26,003
Not in the
time we had.

1471
01:44:26,453 --> 01:44:28,365
That's Ark number 3, sir.

1472
01:44:28,852 --> 01:44:30,568
The roof collapsed
during the shifting

1473
01:44:30,569 --> 01:44:31,528
of the Earth's crust.

1474
01:44:33,015 --> 01:44:34,113
Jesus Christ.

1475
01:44:44,026 --> 01:44:45,334
Hey, what's going on here?

1476
01:44:45,369 --> 01:44:47,864
I have a green card for
my boys and me.

1477
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:50,123
I want to speak to
your supervisor.

1478
01:44:50,124 --> 01:44:51,806
I am the supervisor.

1479
01:44:51,807 --> 01:44:53,193
Get back with the
other green cards,

1480
01:44:53,194 --> 01:44:54,845
or I'll have
you detained.

1481
01:44:56,937 --> 01:44:58,894
What he said about you
and Sasha, is it true?

1482
01:44:58,895 --> 01:45:03,006
Sasha was worth a hundred
times a man like Yuri.

1483
01:45:03,007 --> 01:45:04,945
I should have listened
to you, Dr. Silberman.

1484
01:45:04,946 --> 01:45:07,786
I actually liked the way
I looked before that

1485
01:45:07,787 --> 01:45:10,200
monster talked
me into it.

1486
01:45:10,201 --> 01:45:12,403
Did you know he asked
me for a discount?

1487
01:45:12,404 --> 01:45:14,344
He payed in installments.

1488
01:45:14,345 --> 01:45:15,765
Cheap bastard.

1489
01:45:16,444 --> 01:45:17,666
You hear that?

1490
01:45:20,221 --> 01:45:21,735
Over there!

1491
01:45:25,113 --> 01:45:27,250
Stop!

1492
01:45:33,147 --> 01:45:36,441
Stop!

1493
01:46:07,566 --> 01:46:09,030
How were all these
people chosen?

1494
01:46:09,031 --> 01:46:10,347
Same way your Arc was.

1495
01:46:10,348 --> 01:46:11,413
By experts from all
over the world.

1496
01:46:11,448 --> 01:46:13,252
We had geneticists
determine the perfect

1497
01:46:13,253 --> 01:46:14,877
gene pool we need
to repopulate.

1498
01:46:14,878 --> 01:46:16,566
These people were chosen
by geneticists?

1499
01:46:16,567 --> 01:46:18,518
<i>All green card holders</i>

1500
01:46:18,519 --> 01:46:20,261
<i>Please proceed to
hangar D-4</i>

1501
01:46:20,262 --> 01:46:22,197
Looks to me like their check
books got them on board.

1502
01:46:22,232 --> 01:46:24,132
That's right, Dr Wilson.
Without billions of dollars

1503
01:46:24,167 --> 01:46:26,271
from the private sector
this entire operation

1504
01:46:26,272 --> 01:46:27,232
would've been
impossible.

1505
01:46:27,488 --> 01:46:28,693
We sold tickets?

1506
01:46:29,619 --> 01:46:30,630
What about all
these workers?

1507
01:46:31,391 --> 01:46:32,685
They all get passes?

1508
01:46:33,209 --> 01:46:35,629
What? Life isn't fair?

1509
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:36,660
Is that it?

1510
01:46:37,081 --> 01:46:38,499
If you want to
donate your passes,

1511
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:41,803
to a couple of Chinese
workers, be my guest.

1512
01:46:42,463 --> 01:46:43,829
Captain, I want a
pre-launch briefing.

1513
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:45,673
All international
teams present.

1514
01:47:19,357 --> 01:47:21,162
What the hell?

1515
01:47:24,236 --> 01:47:27,119
What is this? They could've
fit 10 people in here.

1516
01:47:33,922 --> 01:47:35,243
Satnam, where are you?

1517
01:47:35,793 --> 01:47:38,394
- On the Nampan Plateau.
- What?

1518
01:47:40,252 --> 01:47:42,613
There's a tidal wave
coming from the east.

1519
01:47:42,614 --> 01:47:43,765
It's gigantic.

1520
01:47:44,133 --> 01:47:45,676
<i>Satnam, what
happened?</i>

1521
01:47:45,677 --> 01:47:47,470
We never got
picked up, Adrian.

1522
01:47:47,471 --> 01:47:49,658
The airlift
never came.

1523
01:47:51,448 --> 01:47:52,859
Goodbye, my friend.

1524
01:47:53,891 --> 01:47:56,558
Satnam

1525
01:48:21,771 --> 01:48:23,938
- Where are we set up?
- Over there.

1526
01:48:28,554 --> 01:48:31,242
Give me the satellite
images from Napam, India.

1527
01:48:31,655 --> 01:48:32,307
What's happening?

1528
01:48:33,478 --> 01:48:36,078
Satnam was talking
about another wave,

1529
01:48:36,079 --> 01:48:37,614
coming from the east.

1530
01:48:41,059 --> 01:48:42,325
- Holy mother of God.

1531
01:48:42,326 --> 01:48:44,596
So the flooding
will hit earlier?

1532
01:48:44,597 --> 01:48:46,303
The second wave
is closer?

1533
01:48:46,304 --> 01:48:47,382
Plug in the new data.

1534
01:48:49,152 --> 01:48:50,707
Satnam didn't
get picked up.

1535
01:48:50,708 --> 01:48:51,667
What?

1536
01:48:51,887 --> 01:48:54,413
A lot of people didn't get
picked up in this chaos.

1537
01:48:54,723 --> 01:48:56,731
This is not a conspiracy,
Helmsley.

1538
01:48:56,732 --> 01:48:58,045
Your predictions haven't
exactly panned out,

1539
01:48:58,046 --> 01:48:59,603
have they, Doctor?

1540
01:48:59,604 --> 01:49:01,837
It's ready.

1541
01:49:03,422 --> 01:49:05,640
Oh God, its 1500
meters high.

1542
01:49:06,717 --> 01:49:08,114
When will it
get here?

1543
01:49:08,649 --> 01:49:09,728
Talk to me, Hemsley,
when will it hit?

1544
01:49:09,729 --> 01:49:11,886
Adjust the countdown.

1545
01:49:27,069 --> 01:49:30,256
28 minutes, 10 seconds
to impact.

1546
01:49:30,257 --> 01:49:31,035
My God.

1547
01:49:31,437 --> 01:49:33,236
Captain.

1548
01:49:33,237 --> 01:49:35,083
I need to speak to the
other heads of state.

1549
01:49:35,084 --> 01:49:36,493
- Right away. Taylor?
- Aye, Captain

1550
01:49:36,494 --> 01:49:39,930
Standing by. Ark 6, stand by.
Ark 7, stand by.

1551
01:49:39,965 --> 01:49:42,603
This is Carl Anheuser
acting CIC on 4,

1552
01:49:42,604 --> 01:49:43,209
Yes sir

1553
01:49:43,210 --> 01:49:45,282
Requesting emergency
conference T-99.

1554
01:50:05,297 --> 01:50:06,996
He thinks the world of
you, you know that?

1555
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:11,421
He's a great little man.

1556
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:13,245
Yeah

1557
01:50:21,241 --> 01:50:23,119
I always wanted to have
a family of my own.

1558
01:50:27,063 --> 01:50:28,726
You're a lucky
man, Jackson.

1559
01:50:30,089 --> 01:50:31,393
Don't ever forget it.

1560
01:50:33,522 --> 01:50:35,273
CHO MING UTILITY GATE

1561
01:50:47,102 --> 01:50:48,149
Who are they?

1562
01:50:48,611 --> 01:50:50,282
We found them alongside
of the road.

1563
01:50:50,283 --> 01:50:52,234
Send them back!

1564
01:50:57,802 --> 01:50:59,479
I am a follower

1565
01:51:00,227 --> 01:51:02,203
of our great
Lama Rinpoche.

1566
01:51:02,902 --> 01:51:04,312
You know I cannot do that.

1567
01:51:05,758 --> 01:51:07,255
You don't have to
take all of us.

1568
01:51:07,256 --> 01:51:08,344
Please just take
my children.

1569
01:51:08,345 --> 01:51:09,593
I'm begging you.

1570
01:51:09,989 --> 01:51:11,548
Why should
I do that?

1571
01:51:11,549 --> 01:51:15,453
Same reason you
sent for your family.

1572
01:51:15,890 --> 01:51:18,363
Please just the children,
you don't have to take us.

1573
01:51:18,364 --> 01:51:19,324
Please!

1574
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:25,154
Please. Oh my God.

1575
01:51:27,707 --> 01:51:31,391
Please. I don't know if you can
understand what I'm saying.

1576
01:51:31,392 --> 01:51:33,967
As a mother,
I'm begging you.

1577
01:51:33,968 --> 01:51:35,408
Please take them.

1578
01:51:36,666 --> 01:51:37,647
Please.

1579
01:51:40,033 --> 01:51:43,240
We are all children
of the Earth.

1580
01:51:44,030 --> 01:51:47,360
My plan will not work
for so many, Grandma.

1581
01:51:47,361 --> 01:51:51,139
We will take them all.

1582
01:52:05,675 --> 01:52:09,726
Attention.
All construction workers.

1583
01:52:12,318 --> 01:52:14,188
They're opening
the mountain.

1584
01:52:14,189 --> 01:52:17,371
They are leaving
without us.

1585
01:52:18,486 --> 01:52:20,211
Get back. What did
I tell you!

1586
01:52:20,212 --> 01:52:24,057
They are leaving
you behind too.

1587
01:52:24,058 --> 01:52:25,328
<i>Please be patient</i>

1588
01:52:36,996 --> 01:52:39,233
Follow me.

1589
01:52:45,293 --> 01:52:46,728
We have to hurry!

1590
01:52:46,729 --> 01:52:47,997
They are leaving!

1591
01:52:50,648 --> 01:52:52,995
Initiating security
procedures.

1592
01:52:58,168 --> 01:53:00,744
Excuse me. Where can I
find Adrian Helmsley?

1593
01:53:00,745 --> 01:53:02,083
He's on the bridge.
This way.

1594
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:07,335
Tenzin wait!

1595
01:53:08,667 --> 01:53:10,608
Grandma, we're
almost there.

1596
01:53:10,801 --> 01:53:12,741
Green lights on
pressure, Mr Anton?

1597
01:53:12,742 --> 01:53:14,507
Green lights across
the board, Captain.

1598
01:53:26,144 --> 01:53:27,340
Why do they
have anchors?

1599
01:53:27,341 --> 01:53:30,383
Because they're not
space ships. They're Arcs.

1600
01:53:30,846 --> 01:53:31,950
Let's go.

1601
01:53:43,892 --> 01:53:45,249
Mr President.

1602
01:53:46,237 --> 01:53:47,214
You've got to see this.

1603
01:54:16,679 --> 01:54:18,823
Stop.

1604
01:54:26,817 --> 01:54:28,310
Engage the support
mechanisms.

1605
01:54:28,311 --> 01:54:30,906
Aye-aye, Captain.
Engaging supports.

1606
01:54:30,907 --> 01:54:32,130
Just exactly how long
are these things

1607
01:54:32,131 --> 01:54:33,656
expected to hold us
in place, Captain?

1608
01:54:33,657 --> 01:54:34,519
They're just meant
to withstand the

1609
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:37,352
first impact of the
waves, Mr Anheuser.

1610
01:54:53,895 --> 01:54:56,740
Down there Oleg,
you go first.

1611
01:55:01,790 --> 01:55:02,986
Caesar!

1612
01:55:22,901 --> 01:55:26,186
Good boy.
Come to Mommy.

1613
01:55:26,187 --> 01:55:27,240
Caesar!

1614
01:55:27,974 --> 01:55:30,026
Mommy, where's Tamara?

1615
01:55:32,228 --> 01:55:33,937
Daddy look!

1616
01:55:36,668 --> 01:55:38,350
Tamara!

1617
01:56:13,352 --> 01:56:16,781
Oh my god, what's
happening out there?

1618
01:56:17,531 --> 01:56:20,629
Anheuser convinced the other
heads of state to launch.

1619
01:56:23,845 --> 01:56:25,420
Mr. Anheuser

1620
01:56:27,070 --> 01:56:29,011
We have to stop
this madness.

1621
01:56:29,799 --> 01:56:31,723
Make sure the other
bridges can see me.

1622
01:56:32,516 --> 01:56:33,091
What do you think
you're doing?

1623
01:56:33,092 --> 01:56:34,457
I know exactly
what I'm doing.

1624
01:56:37,031 --> 01:56:39,030
Ladies and Gentleman,
this is Dr. Adrian Helmsley

1625
01:56:39,032 --> 01:56:42,111
Chief science adviser to
the late President Wilson.

1626
01:56:42,212 --> 01:56:44,871
Could you please turn up
the volume, Mr Hoffman.

1627
01:56:45,062 --> 01:56:46,070
I know we've all
been forced to make

1628
01:56:46,071 --> 01:56:49,274
difficult decisions to save
our human civilization.

1629
01:56:49,275 --> 01:56:51,968
But to be human means
to care for each other

1630
01:56:52,002 --> 01:56:53,973
and civilization means
to work together

1631
01:56:53,974 --> 01:56:55,908
to create a better life.

1632
01:56:56,041 --> 01:56:58,261
If that's true, then
there's nothing human

1633
01:56:58,262 --> 01:57:01,235
and nothing civilized about
what we're doing here.

1634
01:57:01,236 --> 01:57:03,728
Dr. Helmsley's passion
is admirable,

1635
01:57:03,862 --> 01:57:06,454
But I remind you that
we have very limited

1636
01:57:06,455 --> 01:57:08,159
resources and extremely
limited time.

1637
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:09,855
Ask yourselves, can
we really stand by

1638
01:57:09,856 --> 01:57:12,957
and watch these
people die?

1639
01:57:13,346 --> 01:57:15,362
I read a quote
two days ago.

1640
01:57:15,465 --> 01:57:17,698
The author is probably
dead by now. But he said:

1641
01:57:17,699 --> 01:57:20,074
"The moment we stop
fighting for each other"

1642
01:57:20,078 --> 01:57:23,379
"Thats the moment that
we lose our humanity"

1643
01:57:23,465 --> 01:57:24,655
And in order to save
the human race,

1644
01:57:24,656 --> 01:57:27,163
we have and obligation
to stick to this plan

1645
01:57:27,198 --> 01:57:30,289
which every nation on this
flotilla signed up for.

1646
01:57:30,290 --> 01:57:32,650
They're in God's
hands now.

1647
01:57:34,433 --> 01:57:36,843
Officer, you turn that off.

1648
01:57:37,791 --> 01:57:38,959
That is an order,
sailor. Turn it off!

1649
01:57:38,994 --> 01:57:40,674
Don't you dare touch
that button, young man!

1650
01:57:40,675 --> 01:57:43,488
Have you completely
lost your mind?

1651
01:57:43,816 --> 01:57:44,735
Look at the clock!

1652
01:57:44,914 --> 01:57:47,373
We have barely
15 minutes left!

1653
01:57:47,647 --> 01:57:48,394
Do you want to be
responsible for the

1654
01:57:48,395 --> 01:57:49,966
extinction of the
human race?

1655
01:57:49,967 --> 01:57:51,367
Can you handle
that, Adrian?

1656
01:57:52,023 --> 01:57:54,168
There's a young astrophysicist
from India who's the

1657
01:57:54,169 --> 01:57:55,345
reason we are all here.

1658
01:57:55,346 --> 01:57:56,994
Oh, for God's sake.

1659
01:57:57,145 --> 01:57:59,584
He's the one who
discovered it all.

1660
01:57:59,585 --> 01:58:03,165
He connected all the dots,
we all owe him our lives.

1661
01:58:03,268 --> 01:58:04,557
I just learned that
he was killed with

1662
01:58:04,558 --> 01:58:08,481
his family in a Tsunami
in eastern India.

1663
01:58:09,987 --> 01:58:12,178
He was my friend.

1664
01:58:12,776 --> 01:58:15,009
And he died in vain.

1665
01:58:15,341 --> 01:58:18,373
Everybody out there
has died in vain.

1666
01:58:18,516 --> 01:58:22,385
If we start our future
with an act of cruelty,

1667
01:58:23,671 --> 01:58:28,933
what will you tell
your children?

1668
01:58:31,273 --> 01:58:35,180
If my father were here,
he would open the gates

1669
01:58:41,644 --> 01:58:44,162
The people of Russia
along with...

1670
01:58:45,175 --> 01:58:46,435
China

1671
01:58:48,212 --> 01:58:49,948
and Japan

1672
01:58:49,949 --> 01:58:50,909
Agree

1673
01:58:52,248 --> 01:58:54,489
To open the gates!

1674
01:58:55,884 --> 01:59:00,112
The United Kingdom, Spain,
France and Germany,

1675
01:59:00,116 --> 01:59:02,454
and I believe I may
also speak for the

1676
01:59:02,455 --> 01:59:04,381
Italian Prime Minister:

1677
01:59:04,645 --> 01:59:08,306
We vote to let these
people come in.

1678
01:59:13,095 --> 01:59:15,249
Captain Michaels.

1679
01:59:16,226 --> 01:59:18,800
Please

1680
01:59:21,055 --> 01:59:22,613
This is your Captain.

1681
01:59:22,614 --> 01:59:26,072
In a few moments,
we will open the gates.

1682
01:59:32,941 --> 01:59:35,616
Phew, it stinks.

1683
01:59:53,380 --> 01:59:55,690
They are opening
the gate. Come down!

1684
01:59:55,691 --> 01:59:57,551
Noah. Move it!

1685
01:59:58,075 --> 02:00:00,718
Noah! Noah!

1686
02:00:11,011 --> 02:00:13,013
Mom, something happened.

1687
02:00:20,399 --> 02:00:22,829
Come on, God damn it!
Give me your hand!

1688
02:00:22,830 --> 02:00:26,658
- Reach for it!
- Help me!

1689
02:00:29,009 --> 02:00:31,018
Gordon!

1690
02:00:32,857 --> 02:00:34,504
Stop!

1691
02:00:39,096 --> 02:00:40,578
Climb!

1692
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,191
What's wrong
with the gate?

1693
02:01:14,511 --> 02:01:15,550
Looks like it didn't
run the full cycle.

1694
02:01:15,551 --> 02:01:16,511
We're checking it out.

1695
02:01:18,135 --> 02:01:21,092
Order, please!

1696
02:01:25,326 --> 02:01:28,269
<i>4 minutes to impact</i>

1697
02:02:11,863 --> 02:02:14,881
We're all loaded, Captain.
Then let's lock it up. Now!

1698
02:02:24,427 --> 02:02:27,674
Oleg! Grab
my hand!

1699
02:02:39,109 --> 02:02:45,344
No, no, no

1700
02:02:56,759 --> 02:02:58,087
HYDRAULIC MALFUNCTION

1701
02:02:58,284 --> 02:02:59,863
Something's jamming the
hydraulics, Captain.

1702
02:03:00,004 --> 02:03:01,116
Well then get it out
for Christ sake.

1703
02:03:01,117 --> 02:03:02,463
I can't fire up the
engines until we

1704
02:03:02,464 --> 02:03:03,901
get a good seal
on that gate.

1705
02:03:04,758 --> 02:03:07,099
Captain, we have a breach
in the zoological bay.

1706
02:03:07,244 --> 02:03:09,268
Can you zoom in?
- Yeah.

1707
02:03:13,294 --> 02:03:14,237
I know those kids.

1708
02:03:14,239 --> 02:03:16,679
What is happening?
What's going on?

1709
02:03:16,908 --> 02:03:18,673
Where did they
come from?

1710
02:03:20,461 --> 02:03:22,401
There. Through the
hydraulic chamber.

1711
02:03:22,530 --> 02:03:23,784
Captain, I think we
found the problem!

1712
02:03:23,785 --> 02:03:26,270
- Who are these people?
- No, wait!

1713
02:03:26,676 --> 02:03:27,466
He's injured.

1714
02:03:27,832 --> 02:03:31,403
Something must've
gone wrong.

1715
02:03:31,438 --> 02:03:34,245
Are you kidding me? Of course
something went wrong!

1716
02:03:34,257 --> 02:03:36,061
Congratulations to
the both of you.

1717
02:03:36,125 --> 02:03:37,295
Might have gotten us
all killed, but as long

1718
02:03:37,296 --> 02:03:39,461
as your conscience is
clean, right Helmsley?

1719
02:03:39,462 --> 02:03:41,430
Captain, get an emergency
team down there,

1720
02:03:41,431 --> 02:03:43,114
I'll meet them at the
hydraulics chamber.

1721
02:03:43,115 --> 02:03:44,983
You know your way
around here? Lets go!

1722
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:47,355
<i>1 minute to impact.</i>

1723
02:04:00,344 --> 02:04:01,084
Captain?

1724
02:04:01,553 --> 02:04:03,481
Cho Ming airfield
has been hit.

1725
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:07,694
Put me on emergency
comm, Mr Taylor.

1726
02:04:08,154 --> 02:04:10,278
This is the Captain speaking

1727
02:04:10,339 --> 02:04:13,010
We expect to be impacted
by water shortly.

1728
02:04:13,202 --> 02:04:17,951
We need to
go this way.

1729
02:04:35,004 --> 02:04:38,136
All stations prepare
for impact.

1730
02:05:21,885 --> 02:05:24,296
Pressure just climbed
80 Pascal.

1731
02:05:24,299 --> 02:05:27,024
Surface compression of
valve sensors, Captain.

1732
02:05:27,026 --> 02:05:29,378
Track Dr Helmsley.

1733
02:05:34,013 --> 02:05:36,818
Out of the way!
Excuse me.

1734
02:05:37,511 --> 02:05:39,735
Tenzin. Almost there.

1735
02:05:40,381 --> 02:05:42,046
Nima. What happened?

1736
02:05:44,042 --> 02:05:44,944
Tamara!

1737
02:05:44,945 --> 02:05:47,286
Will you take
the kids please?

1738
02:05:47,605 --> 02:05:48,708
Which way?

1739
02:05:48,891 --> 02:05:52,930
We can't get there!
Water is entering the stern.

1740
02:05:52,964 --> 02:05:55,094
The rear of this ship is
flooded and will seal up

1741
02:05:55,113 --> 02:05:56,667
one compartment
at a time.

1742
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,457
Where's Gordon?

1743
02:05:59,722 --> 02:06:00,735
No?

1744
02:06:02,675 --> 02:06:04,829
We gotta go back!

1745
02:06:04,830 --> 02:06:06,462
We have to go back!

1746
02:06:09,890 --> 02:06:11,078
Mommy!

1747
02:06:12,018 --> 02:06:13,428
Help!
Mommy!

1748
02:06:15,820 --> 02:06:18,371
Run!

1749
02:06:21,948 --> 02:06:25,509
Go over, Lilly!

1750
02:06:26,323 --> 02:06:28,662
Caesar!
Lilly, take him!

1751
02:06:30,758 --> 02:06:32,825
Mommy!

1752
02:06:39,531 --> 02:06:41,781
Is there another way to
the hydraulics chamber?

1753
02:06:41,998 --> 02:06:42,915
Where does this ladder go?

1754
02:06:42,950 --> 02:06:45,932
- To the zoological pens
- Okay, let's go!

1755
02:06:51,566 --> 02:06:54,955
Professor?
It's Air Force One.

1756
02:07:11,401 --> 02:07:13,164
The mid-ship anchor
support is hit.

1757
02:07:13,244 --> 02:07:14,244
Can you stabilize it?

1758
02:07:14,245 --> 02:07:16,013
The bow anchor
is giving in.

1759
02:07:34,661 --> 02:07:36,651
Captain, the turbines
aren't responding.

1760
02:07:36,652 --> 02:07:39,565
So override it.
Hit the override.

1761
02:07:39,598 --> 02:07:41,333
We cant start the engine
until we close that gate.

1762
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:01,357
Help me!
Help!

1763
02:08:06,419 --> 02:08:10,261
Momma!

1764
02:08:10,295 --> 02:08:12,050
- Are you OK?
- My mommy is in there.

1765
02:08:12,051 --> 02:08:13,011
Please help her!

1766
02:08:13,012 --> 02:08:13,836
We'll get to your
mommy, sweetheart.

1767
02:08:13,837 --> 02:08:15,549
They're doing everything
they can, okay?

1768
02:08:15,550 --> 02:08:16,667
Can we talk to her?

1769
02:08:16,702 --> 02:08:18,668
I'm gonna try
to connect us.

1770
02:08:18,701 --> 02:08:20,217
We have to stop
the bleeding!

1771
02:08:20,218 --> 02:08:21,370
How about my belt?

1772
02:08:21,561 --> 02:08:24,407
- Here Mom!
- Mr. Curtis? Jackson?

1773
02:08:25,695 --> 02:08:27,586
Help! Hey!

1774
02:08:27,620 --> 02:08:29,926
It's Adrian Helmsley,
we met at Yellowstone.

1775
02:08:29,959 --> 02:08:32,443
Thats great. Open
the God damn door!

1776
02:08:32,476 --> 02:08:34,231
Your daughter
is with me!

1777
02:08:34,265 --> 02:08:37,357
- Lilly?
- Where's Noah?

1778
02:08:37,390 --> 02:08:39,147
I'm right here, Lil!

1782
02:08:48,272 --> 02:08:51,410
29.000 feet? What the
hell is at 29.000 feet?

1783
02:08:51,444 --> 02:08:53,174
We're headed straight
for the north face

1784
02:08:53,175 --> 02:08:55,679
of Mount Everest,
Mr. Anheuser.

1785
02:08:55,713 --> 02:08:57,757
And if we can't
start our engines,

1786
02:08:57,758 --> 02:08:59,730
we will not survive
the impact.

1787
02:09:09,489 --> 02:09:12,566
Jackson, you're sealed off!
We can't get to you!

1788
02:09:12,567 --> 02:09:14,415
There's something
blocking the hydraulics

1789
02:09:14,416 --> 02:09:16,992
If you can't get it out,
none of us are gonna make it

1790
02:09:18,030 --> 02:09:20,373
Dr Helmsley,
look at this.

1791
02:09:20,976 --> 02:09:23,100
It's completely submerged
down there and there's

1792
02:09:23,101 --> 02:09:24,699
no way for them
to get any air.

1793
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:25,878
Theres no other way!

1794
02:09:25,879 --> 02:09:28,169
But it's a suicide
mission, sir!

1795
02:09:35,104 --> 02:09:37,552
I know where it is,
I'll give it a try.

1796
02:09:43,733 --> 02:09:46,219
Dad, wait, I wanna
go with you!

1797
02:09:46,284 --> 02:09:48,836
- Dad, I wanna help you!
- No, no, no.

1798
02:09:48,837 --> 02:09:50,870
- You are helping me.
- Dad, please!

1799
02:09:50,903 --> 02:09:53,285
Remember when Lilly
was born and you wanted

1800
02:09:53,286 --> 02:09:55,359
to be introduced
as her big brother?

1801
02:09:55,514 --> 02:09:56,896
Well, she's scared now.

1802
02:09:56,897 --> 02:09:58,756
She needs you
more than ever.

1803
02:09:58,758 --> 02:10:01,938
If you're safe, I know that
she's safe. Do you understand?

1804
02:10:08,172 --> 02:10:10,182
You can help me out
the next time.

1805
02:10:12,957 --> 02:10:14,878
We caused this thing,
it was us.

1806
02:10:14,879 --> 02:10:16,663
I gotta go
check it out.

1807
02:10:45,662 --> 02:10:47,413
Can you hear me?

1808
02:10:50,742 --> 02:10:52,363
No

1809
02:11:18,142 --> 02:11:19,209
Press down!

1810
02:11:19,242 --> 02:11:21,011
Press down with
your hand!

1811
02:11:28,899 --> 02:11:31,260
Don't stop.
Keep pressing!

1812
02:11:47,291 --> 02:11:50,665

1815
02:12:02,024 --> 02:12:03,649
- Captain!
- We have a visual!

1816
02:12:03,684 --> 02:12:05,274
I think we found
the problem.

1817
02:12:05,275 --> 02:12:07,273
Show us the
hydraulics chamber

1818
02:12:23,846 --> 02:12:25,809
God dammit! I told you
to stay up there!

1819
02:12:25,810 --> 02:12:27,116
I just wanted to help.

1820
02:12:27,117 --> 02:12:30,328
Alright. Hold the light.

1821
02:12:30,329 --> 02:12:33,034
We're right under
the air pocket, okay?

1822
02:12:33,035 --> 02:12:34,776
How did you know
I needed help?

1823
02:12:39,507 --> 02:12:42,965
Grandpa, Grandma...
I'm sorry.

1824
02:12:42,999 --> 02:12:44,065
I could not save us

1825
02:12:44,436 --> 02:12:47,749
He has gone back in.
He will fix it.

1826
02:12:48,055 --> 02:12:50,669
There's no way.

1827
02:12:51,218 --> 02:12:53,594
Don't lose faith, brother.

1828
02:13:20,253 --> 02:13:21,868
Dad!

1829
02:13:29,004 --> 02:13:30,182
We're gonna die!

1830
02:13:51,525 --> 02:13:54,517
Great job! You light the way
and I'll go for the cable.

1834
02:14:30,115 --> 02:14:31,838
Sir, the gate is sealed!

1835
02:14:31,839 --> 02:14:33,004
That's affirmative, Captain!

1836
02:14:33,005 --> 02:14:36,908
- Anton, start the engines.
- Aye-aye Captain. Full reverse.

- Where's Dad?
- He was right behind me

1845
02:15:54,677 --> 02:15:56,789
Any word from the
hydraulic chamber?

1846
02:15:56,790 --> 02:15:57,598
Where is he?

1847
02:15:57,599 --> 02:15:59,281
I thought you said he
was right behind you.

1848

Shuttle Atlantis.
Our last day.

1859
02:17:46,414 --> 02:17:49,810
All we can hear is the sound
of our own breathing.

1860
02:17:49,811 --> 02:17:51,851
That reminds us we are still

1861
02:17:51,886 --> 02:17:55,113
sharing our memories,
hopes and ideas.

1862
02:17:55,114 --> 02:17:58,525
And isn't it funny?
Just this morning we worked it out

1863
02:17:58,526 --> 02:18:01,859
Somehow or another,
we all have relatives

1864
02:18:01,860 --> 02:18:03,480

I thought you
would like it.

1868
02:18:22,202 --> 02:18:27,702
Tell me Dr Wilson:
Apart from books and art.

1869
02:18:27,703 --> 02:18:28,873
Do you think there's
anything else

1870
02:18:28,874 --> 02:18:29,834
we might possibly share?

1871

In the future?

1872
02:18:34,068 --> 02:18:37,497
Are you asking me out
on a date, Dr. Helmsley?

1873
02:18:38,272 --> 02:18:41,031
You know my diary
is pretty full.

1874

Actually...

1875
02:18:46,421 --> 02:18:48,120
Yes, I was.

1887

<i>and of course...

1890
02:19:39,771 --> 02:19:42,858
Sure, he can be your

Where have you
been all my life?

1893
02:19:49,261 --> 02:19:50,702
Gift shop.

1894
02:20:45,610 --> 02:20:47,839
Oh, Adrian. Excellent.

1895
02:20:47,874 --> 02:20:50,938
I called because we just got
our first satellite feet.

1896
02:20:50,939 --> 02:20:53,368
The equalization of the
oceanic... seabeds

1897
02:20:53,369 --> 02:20:55,917
has not turned out to be
as extreme as we expected.

1898
02:20:55,918 --> 02:20:57,755
The waters are receding.

1899
02:20:57,756 --> 02:20:58,805
Much faster
than we thought.

1900
02:20:58,806 --> 02:21:00,662
Thank God. And...

1901
02:21:00,663 --> 02:21:02,913
This is hard to believe,
but the Himalayas

1902
02:21:02,914 --> 02:21:04,813
are no longer the
roof of the world.

1903
02:21:04,814 --> 02:21:06,688
It's now the
Drakensberg mountains

1904
02:21:06,689 --> 02:21:08,000
of KwaZulu, Nepal.

1905
02:21:08,001 --> 02:21:10,352
The entire African
continent has just risen

1906
02:21:10,353 --> 02:21:12,892
7.000 feet, and unlikely
they are even flooded.

1907
02:21:12,893 --> 02:21:15,597
That's why they call it
The Cape of Good Hope.

1908
02:21:15,598 --> 02:21:17,386
We've already set
course for it.

1909
02:21:24,343 --> 02:21:26,687
Daddy, when will
we go back home?

1910
02:21:26,688 --> 02:21:28,104
Well, we talked
about that.

1911
02:21:28,139 --> 02:21:29,520
We're gonna
find a new home

1912
02:21:29,521 --> 02:21:30,480
out here somewhere.

1913
02:21:30,921 --> 02:21:32,111
Right?

1914
02:21:32,112 --> 02:21:34,861
Wherever we're all
together. That's home.

1915
02:21:34,862 --> 02:21:37,280
Right? You are scared?

1916
02:21:37,281 --> 02:21:38,596
I am not.

1917
02:21:40,517 --> 02:21:42,340
No more pull-ups.

1918
02:21:45,004 --> 02:21:46,448
Nice.
