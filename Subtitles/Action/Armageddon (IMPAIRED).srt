This is the Earth at a time...

when the dinosaurs roamed
a lush and fertile planet.

just six miles wide...

It hit with the force
of 10,000 nuclear weapons.

A trillion tons of dirt and rock

- Is this going to hit us?
- We're efforting that as we speak, sir.

152
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,907
- What kind of damage are we...
- Damage?

153
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,242
Total, sir.

154
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,787
It's what we call a global killer.

155
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,016
The end of mankind.

156
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,285
Doesn't matter where it hits.

157
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:36,589
Nothing would survive.
Not even bacteria.

158
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:40,791
My God. What do we do?

159
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,800
[Groaning]

160
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,973
We have 18 days before it hits Earth.

161
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:06,221
- [Man] Have mercy.
- Rise and shine!

162
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,259
[Yelling]

163
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:11,386
Stop the drilling!
Stop the drilling! Stop the drilling!

164
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:14,091
Fore!

165
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:16,065
Stop the drilling! Stop the drilling!

166
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:19,103
- Hey!
- Hey, that was close!

167
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,003
[Chuckling]

168
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:25,839
I give you 50,000 a year in donations.

169
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,345
- What do you think they're so mad about, Chick?
- Well, I think they feel...

170
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:30,677
that drilling for oil
is an evil thing.

171
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:33,411
You know how much diesel
that clunker boat pumps out an hour?

172
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:38,752
I just found out something interesting.
Number two chewed 180 feet last night.

173
00:12:38,823 --> 00:12:41,314
- Who do we have to thank for this?
- I'll give you two guesses.

174
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,861
But you're only gonna need one.

175
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,328
Goddamn it, A.J.!

176
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,490
A.J.!

177
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:52,997
A.J.! A.J., you in here?

178
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:55,631
Oh, that's just perfect.
In bed. Get up!

179
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:59,768
- Uh, hey, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah, I was lookin' for ya.

180
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:01,778
You're pissed. Okay, I can see that.

181
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:04,815
No. You know what, A.J.?
I'm not pissed. You've seen me pissed.

182
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:08,717
This is way, way beyond pissed, though. You
know I shut down number two last night, right?

183
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,187
- Yeah, man, I had a hunch on that.
- Let me tell you something.

184
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:14,191
Someday, many years from now,
when you're all growed up,

185
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:18,696
and you got your own oil company and $8
million of your own money on the contract,

186
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:22,358
you can do whatever comes into that little
A.J. -idiotin' mind of yours you want.

187
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,835
But as long as it says "Harry Stamper Oil"
on the rig, you will not disobey my rules.

188
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:27,838
- You got that?
- Yeah, I do got it.

189
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:30,397
All right, now I need to hear
five words from you.

190
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:32,636
- Uh...
- I'll...

191
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,804
[Together]
Never do that again.

192
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,347
I'm a fool. That was idiotic.
I- I mean, that was stupid.

193
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:39,076
I'm an idiot. I know
what name's on the sign. I'm not...

194
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,981
- What's goin' on here?
- What's goin' on?

195
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:42,917
Well, I-I mean, you know,
I screwed up. I'm a little edgy.

196
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,151
- How long you work for me?
- Five wonderful years.

197
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:49,819
In five years, you have never
apologized to me this quickly.

198
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:51,885
- Something's going on here. I'm gonna find out what it is.
- [Stammering]

199
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:55,490
Well, I'm turning over a new leaf.
I'm trying to learn from the man.

200
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,660
What would Harry do?

201
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:06,273
I'm at a loss for words.

202
00:14:06,344 --> 00:14:07,868
Okay, I can explain this.

203
00:14:07,946 --> 00:14:09,573
- You can explain that?
- I can.

204
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:13,317
I would really like an explanation.
You just stay right here.

205
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:20,850
Grace?

206
00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:25,293
- Hi, Harry.
- I have asked you repeatedly to call me Dad.

207
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:27,387
Sorry, Harry.

208
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:30,058
Get up and get your clothes on.

209
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:35,363
You just stay right there.
I'll be right back.

210
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:46,415
Here's what we're gonna do. I want every
strategy we've got on near-Earth object collision.

211
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:52,012
Okay? Any ideas, any programs, anything you
sketched on a pizza box or cocktail napkin.

212
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:55,286
For 30 years, they questioned the need for
NASA. Today, we're gonna give 'em the answer.

213
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:01,126
You know about this, Rockhound?

214
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,065
- You knew?
- No, I had no idea.

215
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:08,265
Where's Harry?

216
00:15:08,338 --> 00:15:11,102
Harry, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I understand, okay?

217
00:15:11,174 --> 00:15:13,665
You're mad.
Who-Who wouldn't be mad?

218
00:15:13,744 --> 00:15:15,769
- He's gonna shoot you.
- Nah, no, he's not.

219
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:19,976
Oh, shit.
[Screaming]

220
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,019
- Harry!
- What's wrong with you?

221
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:25,247
Make your peace with God, A.J.!

222
00:15:25,322 --> 00:15:27,415
This guy's got a gun, man.
He's shooting at me.

223
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:31,655
- Harry, this is not funny!
- Harry, listen to me! We can talk this over!

224
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:34,788
- Oh, is this a serious thing?
- Yeah, pretty serious.

225
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:36,389
- Bear!
- What's up?

226
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:38,866
He's shootin' at me. You see Harry
comin', crack him with that wrench.

227
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:42,166
You told A.J.'s dad just before he died
that you would take care of the boy.

228
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:44,332
Now I'm not sure that
shootin' him is takin' care of him.

229
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:47,673
- Why don't you put the gun down?
- You don't want none of this. Get out of my way.

230
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:49,939
Just tryin' to give my man
a head start, that's all.

231
00:15:50,013 --> 00:15:52,948
Not to mention the fact that I don't think
you wanna kill the best man on your crew...

232
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:55,109
- before we strike oil.
- Aw, Chick, I ain't gonna kill him.

233
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:58,279
Just gonna take a foot off.
A man can work with one foot.

234
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:01,051
You remember old Frank Marx who worked
with one hand all them years?

235
00:16:01,124 --> 00:16:02,557
Yeah, but he wasn't very good.

236
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:05,527
Harry, put the gun down!
You're acting insane!

237
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:08,029
Now, honey, go get some clothes on
and get out of the way.

238
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:12,626
- You can't control my life!
- Fine. Clothes. Now!

239
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:15,637
All right, stop! All right! It was funny
for a minute. It's not funny anymore.

240
00:16:17,441 --> 00:16:20,467
- Fuck!
- Harry, this is illegal, man.

241
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,808
I'm temporarily insane, Rock.
It's all right.

242
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,871
[Screaming]

243
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:29,582
- Do I look like I'm crazy to you?
- Well...

244
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:31,177
Harry! Harry! Harry!

245
00:16:31,254 --> 00:16:36,419
All right, now, listen.
Man to man. I'm serious. I love her.

246
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:38,393
Way wrong answer!

247
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:41,158
[Screaming]

248
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:44,029
- Whoa, whoa, Harry. It's gettin' real.
- Harry! Come on, Harry!

249
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,830
- You shot me!
- You shot him.

250
00:16:46,903 --> 00:16:48,837
That bullet never got close.
Just a ricochet.

251
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:51,271
You know, it's all funny
till somebody gets shot in the leg!

252
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:55,277
Hey, pucker up.
We got clients incoming.

253
00:16:56,646 --> 00:16:59,706
Uh, b-back in-in... in 1974,

254
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:03,275
we-we first got the idea... the-the
possibility that-that a meteor or an asteroid...

255
00:17:03,353 --> 00:17:05,913
I need somebody who's had a little less
caffeine this morning. Doc, translate.

256
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:11,052
Yes, sir. Our first feasibility plan was
to use a spread-focus laser generator...

257
00:17:11,127 --> 00:17:13,095
to heat the object
to the point of fracture.

258
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:15,461
That's like shooting a B.B. Gun
at a freight train, Doc.

259
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:17,466
Uh, some of us have got this idea.

260
00:17:17,534 --> 00:17:21,095
We wanna land a craft,
deploy solar sails.

261
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:26,768
You'll have a big canopy. Solar winds
will be caught by these Mylar sails.

262
00:17:26,843 --> 00:17:29,641
- Okay...
- Come on, guys!

263
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:33,479
We gotta come up with something
realistic here. We got 18 days.

264
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,281
That's 431 hours, 15 minutes
and 18 seconds.

265
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:41,085
Time's a luxury we don't have. What?

266
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,992
Listen, Harry, A.J. Is my choice.

267
00:17:45,061 --> 00:17:48,553
- My choice and not yours.
- He's the only one in your age bracket, Grace.

268
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:50,566
It's not a choice.
It's a lack of options.

269
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:53,034
I don't know
what in the world makes you think...

270
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:55,833
that you have the right
to tell me what to do anymore, Harry.

271
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:57,840
I suppose being your father
doesn't count, huh?

272
00:17:57,908 --> 00:17:59,500
- Not really.
- Since when?

273
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:03,103
Since I reached the age of ten
and became older than you, Harry.

274
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,113
Since Mom split.
Why don't you take your pick?

275
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:10,619
Look, I understand that you are handicapped
by natural immaturity, and I forgive you.

276
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:13,884
I may be an immature father,
but I'm still your employer.

277
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:17,154
And as your boss, I want you on that crew
boat tonight and back in the office by Monday.

278
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:20,355
- You got that?
- Okay. I quit.

279
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,263
Grace, you can't quit now!

280
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,665
- I need you to keep on working.
- [Speaking Chinese Dialect]

281
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,532
Hi, Harry!

282
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:31,836
- What are you smilin' about?
- [Speaking Chinese Dialect]

283
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:36,436
I've been seein' A.J.
For more than five months, Harry.

284
00:18:36,513 --> 00:18:38,447
[Speaking Chinese Dialect]

285
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:41,040
You little hypocrite. I ever
held you back once from doing anything?

286
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:43,051
What about having a life, Harry?

287
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,021
The first time I got my period, Rockhound
had to take me into Taipei for Tampax...

288
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,183
and then he had to show me
how to use 'em, Harry.

289
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:51,193
Ho-ho.

290
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:55,527
I ju... No, I-I told her how to
use it. I didn't show her, Harry.

291
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,536
I was playing with titanium depth gauges
when I should've been playing with dolls.

292
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:04,870
I mean, I learned about the birds and
the bees from Freddie Noonan's tattoos.

293
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:07,671
Look, I was raised
on roughnecks by you.

294
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:10,338
And now you get all shocked and shaken
when I fall in love with one.

295
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:13,507
- So who's the hypocrite here, Harry, huh?
- Look at those nice pipes.

296
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:17,383
- Listen to me, Grace.
- No, you listen to me, Harry. I grew up.

297
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:21,652
With the proximity
of the asteroid and no prep time,

298
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:23,989
none of our primary plans can work.

299
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,552
Why don't we just send up 150 nuclear
warheads and blast that rock apart?

300
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:29,428
Terrible idea.

301
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:31,763
Was I talkin' to you?

302
00:19:31,835 --> 00:19:33,666
This is Dr. Ronald Quincy from Research.

303
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:36,570
Pretty much the smartest man on the
planet. You might wanna listen to him.

304
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,234
General, if you consider your target,

305
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:41,743
her composition, her dimensions,

306
00:19:41,811 --> 00:19:43,745
her sheer velocity,

307
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:48,807
you could fire every nuke you've got on her,
she'll just smile at you and keep on coming.

308
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:50,876
You should know that
the president's scientific advisors...

309
00:19:50,954 --> 00:19:54,788
are suggesting that a nuclear blast
could change this asteroid's trajectory.

310
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:59,557
I know the president's chief scientific
advisor. We were at M.I.T. Together.

311
00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:01,927
And, in a situation like this,
[Clears Throat]

312
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:06,230
You really don't wanna take the advice from
a man who got a C-minus in astrophysics.

313
00:20:06,302 --> 00:20:11,535
The president's advisors
are wrong. I'm right.

314
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:14,304
Hitting the rock from
the outside won't do the job.

315
00:20:14,377 --> 00:20:17,642
Imagine a firecracker
in the palm of your hand.

316
00:20:17,714 --> 00:20:21,206
You set it off. What happens?
Burn your hand, right?

317
00:20:21,284 --> 00:20:25,516
You close your fist around
the same firecracker and set it off...

318
00:20:25,588 --> 00:20:29,820
poof... your wife's gonna be opening your
ketchup bottles the rest of your life.

319
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:32,418
Are you suggesting that we blow
this thing up from the inside?

320
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:34,463
- That's exactly what I'm saying.
- How?

321
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:37,022
[Sighs]
We drill.

322
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,227
We bring in the world's best
deep-core driller.

323
00:20:39,302 --> 00:20:41,270
Harry, get up here.
We're takin' a hit.

324
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:43,965
- Get A.J. Up here!
- Come on!

325
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,905
- Oh, shit!
- [Yelling]

326
00:20:45,975 --> 00:20:48,239
Send another pipe down! Right now!

327
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:51,303
- [Yelling Continues]
- It's a gas pocket!

328
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:53,679
I told you! Am I lucky,
or am I just a genius?

329
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,810
I shut it down for a reason,
you jackass! The relief valve's...

330
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:59,684
[Screaming]

331
00:20:59,756 --> 00:21:04,159
Shut off the number two valve!
Grace, get the clients out of here now!

332
00:21:04,227 --> 00:21:06,491
[Alarm Blaring]

333
00:21:06,563 --> 00:21:09,828
- No, Daddy!
- [Screaming]

334
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:13,096
Chick, get 'em outta here!
Get 'em off the rig now!

335
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:21,200
- Get the hell down!
- This thing is gonna blow.

336
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:27,542
[Screaming]

337
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:31,678
- [Yelling Continues]
- Chick, get down now!

338
00:21:31,755 --> 00:21:35,953
Get down!

339
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:39,051
[Dan] Three dozen research calls, and
every time, the same man is recommended.

340
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:41,495
He's worked on every terrain
this planet can offer.

341
00:21:41,564 --> 00:21:44,397
Whenever they said it couldn't be
drilled, this guy drilled it.

342
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:47,561
- Everybody all right?
- We struck oil, baby!

343
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:51,164
Somebody could've got killed out here
today. You want that on your conscience?

344
00:21:53,777 --> 00:21:55,745
High thumb.
You are man, Harry.

345
00:21:55,812 --> 00:21:58,576
- Thumbs high.
- [Helicopter Blades Whirring]

346
00:22:00,216 --> 00:22:02,207
You're fired.

347
00:22:07,122 --> 00:22:09,682
Who's Harry Stamper?

348
00:22:09,758 --> 00:22:12,989
Hey, I'm Harry Stamper.
What's all this about?

349
00:22:13,062 --> 00:22:16,225
Mr. Stamper, I'm General Montgomery,
commander of the Pacific air forces.

350
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:19,062
I've been sent here
by the secretary of defense...

351
00:22:19,134 --> 00:22:21,762
on direct orders
from the president of the United States.

352
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:25,034
- [Chuckling]
- It's a matter of urgent national security.

353
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:28,270
I need you to get on that chopper
right now, no questions asked.

354
00:22:28,344 --> 00:22:30,403
Crazy Willie put you up to this?

355
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:34,916
I'm afraid I don't know Crazy Willie,
sir. I'm dead serious about this.

356
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:38,719
- Harry.
- What?

357
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:40,755
I swear to God,
she never told me her age.

358
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:44,190
It's all right. Relax. It's about me.

359
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:46,693
Oh. Forget it!

360
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:54,966
All right, General,
I'll go with you on one condition.

361
00:22:55,037 --> 00:22:56,971
We're gonna have
to take my daughter along.

362
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:01,875
- What did I do?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you guys takin' her?

363
00:23:01,944 --> 00:23:04,208
- Sir, stay right here.
- Wh...

364
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,271
Chick, get him paid,
get him off the rig!

365
00:23:17,226 --> 00:23:20,662
- Mr. Stamper?
- Yeah, I'm Harry Stamper.

366
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:23,095
How you doin'? Miss Stamper.

367
00:23:23,165 --> 00:23:25,099
I'm Dan Truman, Executive Director here.

368
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:27,431
- Listen, on behalf of all of us, I'd really like to apologize...
- Apologize.

369
00:23:27,503 --> 00:23:29,869
I don't know if we can take
any more apologies, Mr. Truman.

370
00:23:29,938 --> 00:23:32,463
We've been apologized to
for the last 18-and-a-half hours.

371
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,601
So if you don't mind, how about
if we just get on with it?

372
00:23:35,677 --> 00:23:37,577
You tell us why we're here
at the NASA Space Center.

373
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:39,807
We should probably talk alone.

374
00:23:39,882 --> 00:23:42,476
Mr. Truman, I don't keep
any secrets from my daughter, Grace.

375
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:45,987
So whether you tell her now or I tell her
later, she's gonna find out one way or the other.

376
00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:47,988
So why don't we just get on with it?

377
00:23:48,056 --> 00:23:51,992
[Dan] So when the Rogue comet hit the
asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.

378
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,325
For the next 15 days,
the Earth's in a shooting gallery.

379
00:23:55,397 --> 00:23:59,299
Even if the asteroid itself
hits the water, it's still hitting land.

380
00:23:59,368 --> 00:24:04,169
It'll flash boil millions of gallons of
seawater and slam into the ocean bedrock.

381
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:07,606
Now, if it's a Pacific Ocean impact...
which we think it will be...

382
00:24:07,676 --> 00:24:10,509
it'll create a tidal wave
three miles high,

383
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:15,209
traveling at 1,000 miles an hour covering
California and washing up in Denver.

384
00:24:15,284 --> 00:24:18,879
Japan's gone.
Australia's wiped out.

385
00:24:18,954 --> 00:24:22,583
Half the world's population
will be incinerated by the heat blast.

386
00:24:22,658 --> 00:24:24,819
The rest'll freeze to death
from nuclear winter.

387
00:24:24,893 --> 00:24:27,657
[Whispering]
That's unbelievable.

388
00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:31,722
Well, actually,
this is as real as it gets.

389
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:36,637
Well, it's coming right now.

390
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:39,902
Right for us at 22,000 miles an hour.

391
00:24:39,975 --> 00:24:43,240
Not a soul on Earth can hide from it.

392
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,190
I take it you're not
alerting everyone like this.

393
00:25:01,263 --> 00:25:04,061
Nobody knows.
That's the way it stays.

394
00:25:04,132 --> 00:25:07,533
For the next ten days, there are
only nine telescopes in the world...

395
00:25:07,603 --> 00:25:09,867
that can spot the asteroid,
and we control eight of 'em.

396
00:25:09,938 --> 00:25:12,930
The president's classified
this information top secret.

397
00:25:13,008 --> 00:25:14,908
If news like this got out,

398
00:25:14,977 --> 00:25:18,344
there'd be an overnight breakdown
of basic social services worldwide.

399
00:25:18,413 --> 00:25:23,749
Rioting, mass religious hysteria,
total chaos, you can imagine.

400
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:26,947
Basically the worst parts of the Bible.

401
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:32,725
Six billion people on the planet.

402
00:25:32,794 --> 00:25:35,092
Why'd you guys call me?

403
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:38,599
- We need you to prep the team we're sending up.
- Up?

404
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:42,194
We'll send them to the asteroid, they'll
land, drill a hole, they'll drop some nukes,

405
00:25:42,271 --> 00:25:45,263
take off and detonate,
if we can fix this equipment problem.

406
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:50,243
The drilling unit's a prototype we've
been building for the Mars project.

407
00:25:50,312 --> 00:25:54,214
You, uh... You might recognize the rig.

408
00:25:54,283 --> 00:25:58,549
Yeah, well, I guess
I should recognize it. It's my design.

409
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,214
- [Man Chattering On P.A.]
- [Helicopter Blades Whirring]

410
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,953
- Did you steal a key to the Patent Office?
- Yeah, basically.

411
00:26:05,027 --> 00:26:07,894
Let me get this straight.
I got pulled off an oil rig,

412
00:26:07,963 --> 00:26:11,057
flown halfway around the world
because you stole my drill design.

413
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:15,126
Couldn't read the plans right and did
a pisspoor job of putting it together.

414
00:26:15,203 --> 00:26:17,728
- Patents don't apply to outer space.
- [Dan] You shut up, Quincy.

415
00:26:17,806 --> 00:26:21,242
It's not going to Mars anymore.
It's gonna try to save this planet.

416
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,574
And we need to know
what's wrong with it pretty quick.

417
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:26,808
- You said we did a bad job of putting it together?
- No, I said...

418
00:26:26,882 --> 00:26:29,248
you did a pisspoor job
of putting it together.

419
00:26:29,318 --> 00:26:32,651
First of all, you got the flow system
all reversed. Let me guess.

420
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:36,350
- You've been tearin' up rotors and you can't figure out why.
- Yeah, that's right.

421
00:26:36,425 --> 00:26:39,019
Well, that's because
your cams are all wrong, Mr. Wizard.

422
00:26:39,094 --> 00:26:42,359
Who's been operating this thing?

423
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:44,797
- Right there.
- We've actually...

424
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:48,461
- We've had them training for eight months solid now.
- Eight whole months?

425
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:51,028
- Well, pretty much, yeah.
- Well, gee whiz.

426
00:26:51,106 --> 00:26:53,506
Well, this is the team
that has to do the job up there.

427
00:26:53,575 --> 00:26:55,600
We need you to train them down here.

428
00:26:55,677 --> 00:26:57,440
Well, Mr. Stamper, what do you think?

429
00:26:57,512 --> 00:27:00,709
You know, drilling's a science.
It's an art.

430
00:27:00,782 --> 00:27:02,977
I'm a third generation driller,
doin' it all my life.

431
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:05,315
I still haven't got it all figured out.

432
00:27:05,387 --> 00:27:08,686
I assume you sent for me because
somebody told you I was the best.

433
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:11,658
Well, I'm only the best
because I work with the best.

434
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:15,663
You don't trust the men you're working
with, you're as good as dead.

435
00:27:15,731 --> 00:27:17,892
Now you wanna send
these boys into space, fine.

436
00:27:17,966 --> 00:27:19,900
I'm sure they'll make good astronauts,

437
00:27:19,968 --> 00:27:22,698
but they don't know jack about drillin'.

438
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:25,535
- What's your contingency plan?
- Contingency plan?

439
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:27,802
Your backup plan. You gotta have
some kind of backup plan, right?

440
00:27:27,876 --> 00:27:29,844
No, we don't have a backup plan.

441
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:31,845
- This is it.
- This is the best that you could...

442
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:35,314
that the government...
the U.S. Government can come up with.

443
00:27:35,384 --> 00:27:38,683
I mean, you're NASA for cryin' out loud.
You put a man on the moon.

444
00:27:38,754 --> 00:27:42,053
You're geniuses.
You're the guys that think this shit up.

445
00:27:42,124 --> 00:27:44,649
I'm sure you got a team of men
sittin' around somewhere right now,

446
00:27:44,726 --> 00:27:47,126
just thinkin' shit up
and somebody backin' them up.

447
00:27:47,195 --> 00:27:49,891
You tell me you don't have a backup plan,
that these eight Boy Scouts right here,

448
00:27:49,965 --> 00:27:54,425
- that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
- Yeah.

00:27:54,503 --> 00:27:56,198
Oh, Jesus. Damn it.

450
00:27:56,271 --> 00:28:00,799
We're a little short on time here.
Will you help us?

451
00:28:05,113 --> 00:28:08,241
- All they gotta do is drill?
- That's it.

452
00:28:08,316 --> 00:28:11,683
- No spacewalkin', no crazy astronaut stuff.
- Just drill.

453
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:15,756
How many men were you
plannin' on takin' up there?

454
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:17,917
We're sendin' up
two shuttles, two teams.

455
00:28:17,993 --> 00:28:20,359
If I do this,
I'm gonna wanna take my own men.

You got it.

- Yes, sir.

Thanks.

yellow jelly bear claws I like?

- Yeah.

How about Benny? He's good.

The only one who knows how
to run it as well as I do is A.J.

492
00:30:27,488 --> 00:30:29,888
I thought you said
you couldn't trust him.

493
00:30:29,957 --> 00:30:31,857
I thought you said I could.

494
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:36,896
Yep, you are on your way, A.J.

You don't got a gun
on you now, do you?

to get back to this whole thing...

like that, or is it that?

You know, you and me
got a real problem.

You know, Harry,
there are only...

00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:19,071
five words I wanna hear
from you right now.

Those words are:

00:31:21,008 --> 00:31:24,375
You know, A.J., I really look up to you.

511
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:28,438
You've been a hero of mine for a long
time, and I'm very impressed with your work.

512
00:31:28,516 --> 00:31:32,316
I'm emotionally closed off. That's
like... That's like 11 words or something.

00:31:32,387 --> 00:31:36,255
You know what?
How about just, "A.J., I'm sorry,

00:31:36,324 --> 00:31:38,656
- and I love ya. "
- You know, A.J.,

there's not a job on the planet
I want you to work with me on.

00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:46,565
I mean that.

517
00:31:48,002 --> 00:31:52,098
So what are you doin' here?
Harry, what's the job?

518
00:31:54,308 --> 00:31:58,836
- Hey, Bear.
- What's up, baby? Yeah, baby. What's up? What's up?

519
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,017
What's up, Harry?
Did NASA find oil on Uranus, man?

about this scenario, give it up.

of encouraged. This guy Chick here...

We got a collection agent for the mob.
Two of these guys have done serious time.

- So am I.

547
00:33:36,577 --> 00:33:38,511
And I'm not so optimistic.

548
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:41,707

is shockingly bad.

589
00:36:08,262 --> 00:36:11,095
Gotta lay off those pork rinds, Bear!

590
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:13,895
Pork rinds this! Yeah!

591
00:36:18,438 --> 00:36:20,668
Well, at least they're in good spirits.

592
00:36:24,912 --> 00:36:28,678
Piece of cake.
Look, you wanna compare brain pans?

593
00:36:28,749 --> 00:36:31,582
I won the Westinghouse prize
when I was 12. Big deal.

594
00:36:31,652 --> 00:36:35,645
Published at 19. So what? I got
a double doctorate from M.I.T. At 22.

595
00:36:35,722 --> 00:36:39,123
Chemistry and geology. I taught
at Princeton for two-and-a-half years.

596
00:36:39,193 --> 00:36:43,459
You know, I think this might be the most
uncomfortable room I've ever been in in my life.

597
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,590
Why do I do this? Because
the money's good, the scenery changes,

598
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:49,101
and they let me use explosives, okay?

599
00:36:49,169 --> 00:36:51,933
Okay, you wanna be
all psychological with me, that's fine.

600
00:36:52,005 --> 00:36:54,599
I'll tell you one thing
that really drives me nuts...

601
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:58,270
is people who think Jethro Tull
is just a person in the band.

602
00:36:58,345 --> 00:37:00,939
Who is Jethro Tull?

603
00:37:01,014 --> 00:37:04,506
My favorite dish is haggis.
Heart, lungs, liver.

604
00:37:04,585 --> 00:37:07,884
You shove that all
in a sheep's stomach, then you boil it.

605
00:37:07,955 --> 00:37:09,445
That'll put some hair on your ass.

606
00:37:09,523 --> 00:37:12,959
I am not crazy. I'm just
a little emotional right now, okay?

607
00:37:13,026 --> 00:37:15,756
You're all throwin'
all this stuff at me, man. I mean...

608
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:18,320
After this is over, could I, like,
get a hug from you or somethin'?

609
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,732
Okay, Cyclops lady
is startin' to bug me.

610
00:37:22,803 --> 00:37:25,795
- Can you handle it?
- I mean, I can handle what I'm, you know, gonna do.

611
00:37:25,873 --> 00:37:27,807
I can handle that, but I don't know
if I can handle this room.

612
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,809
Woman with large breasts.

613
00:37:31,979 --> 00:37:33,913
Woman with medium breasts.

614
00:37:33,981 --> 00:37:35,915
Here's Harry givin' me a hard time.

615
00:37:35,983 --> 00:37:38,042
And this is Harry tellin' me
it's not good enough.

616
00:37:38,118 --> 00:37:41,679
And this is Harry tellin' me I can't marry
his daughter. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

617
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:44,588
- Just let it out.
- [Crying]

618
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:47,252
I suffered a major head injury
when I was in high school.

619
00:37:47,327 --> 00:37:50,592
This one looks like you...
with breasts.

620
00:37:50,664 --> 00:37:52,825
Yeah, I can handle it.
Yeah, I can handle it.

621
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:59,366
A home run!
The Cubs win the World Series! Ah...

622
00:37:59,439 --> 00:38:03,466
Fail. Fail. Depressively fail.

623
00:38:03,543 --> 00:38:06,944
One toxicology analysis
revealed catamen.

624
00:38:07,014 --> 00:38:09,278
That is a very powerful sedative.

625
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:12,716
- Sedatives are used all the time, Doctor.
- This one's used on horses.

626
00:38:14,288 --> 00:38:16,279
Some of these guys are pretty big.

627
00:38:16,356 --> 00:38:18,790
It would normally take 18 months
to psychologically prepare,

628
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:21,384
prescreen viable subjects
for space travel.

629
00:38:21,461 --> 00:38:24,953
We have seen evidence of a wide
variety of territorial aggression.

630
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:28,729
Can they physically survive the trip?
That's all I need to know here, okay?

631
00:38:28,802 --> 00:38:31,896
Personally, I don't know
how they survived the tests.

632
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,901
Talk about the wrong stuff.

633
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,245
Good morning. I'm Colonel Willie Sharp.

634
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:48,186
In addition to flying
one of the X-71 teams to that rock,

635
00:38:48,255 --> 00:38:52,316
my job is to train you to deal with the mental
and physical rigors of working in space...

636
00:38:52,392 --> 00:38:55,088
so you don't freak out on the asteroid.

637
00:38:55,162 --> 00:38:59,565
United States astronauts
train for years.

638
00:38:59,633 --> 00:39:01,567
You have 12 days.

639
00:39:01,635 --> 00:39:04,001
Do we have any intelligent
questions before we get started?

640
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:07,400
What's an X-71?

641
00:39:07,474 --> 00:39:11,410
You're the first civilians
to ever see her.

642
00:39:11,478 --> 00:39:13,537
We call 'em the X-71s.

643
00:39:13,613 --> 00:39:16,309
It's a top secret joint venture
with the Air Force.

644
00:39:16,383 --> 00:39:20,046
She and her sister ship in Vandenberg
are leaving for launch prep in Florida.

645
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,352
Thought you oughta take a look. The two shuttles
going up are the Freedom and Independence.

646
00:39:24,424 --> 00:39:27,621
Her titanium alloy impenetrable
skin covers the toughest, meanest,

647
00:39:27,694 --> 00:39:30,754
most sophisticated space vehicle
man has ever made.

648
00:39:30,831 --> 00:39:33,299
Okay, Air Force Colonel Davis,
NASA pilot Tucker...

649
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:35,301
will command the shuttle Independence.

650
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:39,032
Air Force Colonel Sharp,
NASA pilot Watts, shuttle Freedom.

651
00:39:39,106 --> 00:39:43,440
Munitions specialist Gruber and Halsey
will supervise the nuclear ordinance.

652
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,809
Anyway, I just thought...

653
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,075
thought you guys should meet.

654
00:39:51,685 --> 00:39:55,621
Gentlemen, welcome to our weightless
environmental training facility.

655
00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:05,963
So we're going swimming on
this asteroid. Is that what this is for?

656
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:09,992
Here at downtown NASA, we call
this monster "Armadillo. "

657
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,004
Going to be retrofitted
with your drilling arm.

658
00:40:12,072 --> 00:40:14,063
She'll turn 800 turbo horses
in near-zero gravity.

659
00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:15,836
Mind if we take a look at her now?

660
00:40:15,909 --> 00:40:19,140
All these rubber hoses
gotta go, Max. Count 'em up.

661
00:40:19,212 --> 00:40:22,079
Make sure it's short-throw shifters.

662
00:40:22,149 --> 00:40:25,448
Quincy!
Somebody tell me what this is.

663
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,580
Plastic ice cream scoop?
What'd that cost? About $400.

664
00:40:29,656 --> 00:40:34,116
This is about the sorriest group of people
I've seen in all my entire military career.

665
00:40:34,194 --> 00:40:37,686
Your space flight's gonna be
a brutal assault on your senses.

666
00:40:37,764 --> 00:40:42,098
I'm here to give you a taste of that. NASA's
got some of the finest pilots in the world.

667
00:40:42,169 --> 00:40:45,263
They're gonna be suckin' your eyes
into the back of your heads.

668
00:40:46,606 --> 00:40:49,268
Go easy on me, okay?
It's my first time.

669
00:40:49,342 --> 00:40:52,277
I just wanna seriously say
I have a small fear of flying.

670
00:40:52,345 --> 00:40:54,313
[A.J. Screaming]

671
00:40:54,381 --> 00:40:57,214
- I'm gonna twist ya.
- [Screaming Continues]

672
00:40:59,786 --> 00:41:02,152
- I'm gonna flip ya.
- What's the matter with you?

673
00:41:03,457 --> 00:41:05,948
Frap your body till your bones hurt.

674
00:41:06,026 --> 00:41:09,052
When you squeal, I'm just
gonna go faster and harder.

675
00:41:09,129 --> 00:41:12,792
No, take me down!
[Screaming]

676
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:16,629
- How's the rest of the crew?
- Well, uh...

677
00:41:16,703 --> 00:41:19,331
Sorry about the rib chunks
all over your dashboard.

678
00:41:22,209 --> 00:41:24,040
Don't forget: We gotta X-ray all these...

679
00:41:24,111 --> 00:41:26,773
- If you had to say, who would you say?
- I don't know, Oscar.

680
00:41:26,847 --> 00:41:29,247
- Who do you think you are?
- Han Solo.

681
00:41:29,316 --> 00:41:31,011
No, if anybody's anybody, I'm Han.

682
00:41:31,084 --> 00:41:33,018
And you're... you're Chewbacca.

683
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:35,919
Chewie? Have you even seen Star Wars?

684
00:41:35,989 --> 00:41:38,480
[Man]
All right, let's go.

685
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:47,690
Neil Armstrong, 1969,
bouncing on the moon.

686
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:51,134
He's bouncing up there because there's
less gravity up there than on Earth.

687
00:41:51,204 --> 00:41:54,105
This will be similar
to the asteroid, so watch it.

688
00:41:54,174 --> 00:41:57,109
Something gets launched
off that asteroid with enough force,

689
00:41:57,177 --> 00:41:59,577
it's gonna keep on going
right into outer space.

690
00:41:59,646 --> 00:42:03,343
What is the deal?
Is it just me, or is Watts really hot?

691
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:05,350
Yeah.

692
00:42:05,418 --> 00:42:09,411
We have these new generation suits with
directional accelerant thrusters.

693
00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:11,286
- You won't bounce like Neil Armstrong.
- Yeah, think so?

694
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:13,053
- Bear!
- Yes?

695
00:42:13,126 --> 00:42:16,186
- Do we have a problem?
- No.

696
00:42:16,263 --> 00:42:20,757
'Cause I'm trying to describe to you how
these D.A.T. S keep your ass on the ground.

697
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:23,029
- So that if I were to kick you in the balls,
- Ooh.

698
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,469
And you don't know
how to work them, what happens to you?

699
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:28,099
- I float away.
- Yeah.

700
00:42:28,175 --> 00:42:31,076
And when do we start training for that?

701
00:42:31,144 --> 00:42:33,635
Gentlemen, I'll give you 30 seconds
to put your helmets on.

702
00:42:33,713 --> 00:42:35,943
Then the oxygen will be sucked
out of this vacuum,

703
00:42:36,016 --> 00:42:38,917
and you will know what it's like
to be in space. Go!

704
00:42:38,985 --> 00:42:42,580
[Man On P.A.]
Depressurize in 30 seconds.

705
00:42:42,656 --> 00:42:44,988
Main valves have been activated.

706
00:43:03,878 --> 00:43:06,278
Okay, gentlemen,
so here's the flight plan.

707
00:43:06,347 --> 00:43:09,145
Now let's keep the laughter to
a minimum. I know this is not to scale.

708
00:43:09,217 --> 00:43:14,348
Both shuttles will take off
Tuesday at 6:30 p. m.

709
00:43:14,422 --> 00:43:16,913
Now 67 minutes later,

710
00:43:16,991 --> 00:43:20,825
you're gonna dock with the Russian space
station to meet cosmonaut Andropov...

711
00:43:20,895 --> 00:43:23,921
who will refuel the shuttles
with liquid O2.

712
00:43:23,998 --> 00:43:26,626
That's your fuel.
Then you'll release...

713
00:43:26,701 --> 00:43:29,499
and take a 60-hour trip
toward the moon.

714
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:33,768
Now we only have one shot
of landing on this rock,

715
00:43:33,841 --> 00:43:37,299
and that's precisely when
the asteroid passes by the moon.

716
00:43:37,378 --> 00:43:40,313
You'll then use lunar gravity
and burn your thrusters,

717
00:43:40,381 --> 00:43:43,817
slingshotting you around the moon,

718
00:43:43,884 --> 00:43:46,284
coming up behind the asteroid.

719
00:43:46,354 --> 00:43:49,653
- You'll be upward of 11 Gs.
- Yeah, I remember this one.

720
00:43:49,724 --> 00:43:53,125
It's where the coyote sat
his ass down in a slingshot...

721
00:43:53,194 --> 00:43:56,061
and he strapped himself
to an Acme rocket.

722
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:58,496
- Is-Is that what we're doin' here?
- Rockhound.

723
00:43:58,566 --> 00:44:01,126
No, no, really, because it didn't
work out too well for the coyote, Harry.

724
00:44:01,202 --> 00:44:05,662
- [Overlapping Chattering]
- Actually, we have a lot better rockets than the coyote.

725
00:44:06,907 --> 00:44:08,841
Now when you've finished...

726
00:44:08,909 --> 00:44:11,673
your Road Runner thrust move,

727
00:44:11,746 --> 00:44:15,580
you'll be moving
at 22,500 miles per hour.

728
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,743
Coming around behind the asteroid,

729
00:44:17,818 --> 00:44:20,878
where we're hoping that the tail debris
will be cleared by the moon's gravity.

730
00:44:20,955 --> 00:44:23,185
And you'll land right here.
That's it.

731
00:44:23,257 --> 00:44:25,725
We got separate landing sites
for each team.

732
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:27,590
Softest parts of the rock
as we can figure.

733
00:44:27,662 --> 00:44:31,462
At NASA, we don't take chances.
We double up on everything.

734
00:44:31,532 --> 00:44:34,228
First team that hits 800 feet wins.

735
00:44:34,302 --> 00:44:38,329
Now this rock is big, dense. It's got
some gravity. You can walk around,

736
00:44:38,406 --> 00:44:40,931
but use your thrusters
so you can work easier.

737
00:44:41,008 --> 00:44:45,172
Okay, Mr. Truman, let's say
that we actually do land on this.

738
00:44:45,246 --> 00:44:47,737
What's it gonna be like up there?

739
00:44:47,815 --> 00:44:50,682
Two hundred degrees in the sunlight.
Minus 200 in the shade.

740
00:44:50,751 --> 00:44:55,620
Canyons of razor-sharp rock.
Unpredictable gravitational conditions.

741
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:58,591
Unexpected eruptions.
Things like that.

742
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:02,288
Okay, so the scariest
environment imaginable. Thanks.

743
00:45:02,363 --> 00:45:04,888
That's all you gotta say:
Scariest environment imaginable.

744
00:45:04,965 --> 00:45:08,025
Okay, so you drill,
you drop the nuke and you leave.

745
00:45:08,102 --> 00:45:12,630
Now here's the key.
You're gonna remote detonate the bomb...

746
00:45:12,707 --> 00:45:17,406
before the asteroid passes
this plane, zero barrier.

747
00:45:17,478 --> 00:45:21,278
You do that, and the remaining
pieces of rock...

748
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:24,614
should be deflected enough
to pass right by us.

749
00:45:24,685 --> 00:45:27,245
Now if the bomb explodes
after zero barrier,

750
00:45:31,058 --> 00:45:32,150
game's over.

751
00:45:32,226 --> 00:45:34,660
Paul, this is Houston,
fire your rockets!

752
00:45:34,729 --> 00:45:37,562
- [Lmitating Rocket Blasting]
- Okay, your rockets are maximum.

753
00:45:37,631 --> 00:45:41,795
- Oscar!
- Hey, Harry. Hey, how's it goin'?

754
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:44,337
- Have you seen Grace?
- Yeah, she's over in the hangar with A.J.

755
00:45:44,405 --> 00:45:49,240
Harry, wait a second. Did you say
Grace? Okay, I thought you said Bear.

756
00:46:25,613 --> 00:46:27,547
Will you marry me?

757
00:46:41,462 --> 00:46:43,396
Grace is old enough to vote, Harry.

758
00:46:43,464 --> 00:46:46,456
She's old enough to drink or get married
if she wants to, get a divorce.

759
00:46:46,534 --> 00:46:49,697
Let me tell you something, fellas. When
I get back, when we get this job done,

760
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,704
I will deal with this in my own way.

761
00:46:51,772 --> 00:46:53,933
Come on, Harry. It's not like
I'm rootin' for A.J. Here.

762
00:46:54,008 --> 00:46:55,942
- I'm just sayin', Grace is not a little girl anymore.
- Hey, Rock.

763
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:57,944
Wait a minute. Let me get
a pencil and a piece of paper.

764
00:46:58,012 --> 00:46:59,946
I wanna jot down
all your pearls of wisdom here.

765
00:47:00,014 --> 00:47:03,506
Get serious, Harry. Come on. While we're
off trottin' the globe, hunting mud,

766
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:06,314
Gracie grew up to become
a full-blown hottie, you know?

767
00:47:06,387 --> 00:47:09,481
- Harry, she is fully hot. She is...
- She's a babe.

768
00:47:09,557 --> 00:47:12,617
Max, okay, you're talkin'
about my little girl, all right?

769
00:47:12,693 --> 00:47:15,218
I think I know
who and what she is, okay?

770
00:47:15,296 --> 00:47:19,062
Harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin'
about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.

771
00:47:19,133 --> 00:47:23,729
She's gettin' curious about her body, and
she's exploring her sexuality. You know what?

772
00:47:23,804 --> 00:47:26,034
- Oscar.
- That's a natural thing.

773
00:47:26,106 --> 00:47:29,701
You are about five minutes older than
Grace is. Why should I listen to you?

774
00:47:29,777 --> 00:47:32,405
I know what it feels like to have
your hormones pullin' you in just...

775
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,414
a thousand different directions.

776
00:47:34,482 --> 00:47:37,576
No disrespect, man,
but we all helped to raise her.

777
00:47:37,651 --> 00:47:42,020
- So, in part, we all feel like a bunch of daddies here.
- That's true.

778
00:47:42,089 --> 00:47:47,026
I'll be damned if I worked all these years
so my little girl can marry a roughneck.

779
00:47:49,163 --> 00:47:51,723
She's better than that.

780
00:47:51,799 --> 00:47:54,131
Better than all of us.

781
00:48:01,642 --> 00:48:05,544
Harry, just sit back, relax. I'm gonna
put on a free Armadillo driving clinic.

782
00:48:05,613 --> 00:48:07,808
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Harry!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

[Shouting]

784
00:48:13,954 --> 00:48:15,922
Two shuttle teams.

785
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:20,017
A.J.'ll be running the drill team with
Oscar, Bear and Noonan on the Independence.

786
00:48:20,094 --> 00:48:23,393
I'll run the drill team on Freedom
with Chick, Rockhound and Max.

787
00:48:23,464 --> 00:48:25,659
Once we land, we'll have
eight hours to get the job done.

788
00:48:25,733 --> 00:48:30,329
In order to split this rock on the fault
line, we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.

789
00:48:30,404 --> 00:48:34,875
Let's get our game faces on.
Now it's time for underwater simulation.

790
00:48:35,008 --> 00:48:39,138
[A.J.] Come on. Let's keep it up.
Let's go. We're the younger team here.

791
00:48:39,212 --> 00:48:42,443
We're on the varsity team.
Take it to 11,000.

792
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:45,450
Okay, gentlemen, we're gonna trick
'em up. My computer will simulate...

793
00:48:45,518 --> 00:48:50,421
a gas pocket at 625 feet
and then hard iron ferrite at 635.

794
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:53,482
I'm gonna drill some more.
We're takin' her up.

795
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,586
- I'm givin' it more torque right now.
- All right, lookin' good, Bear.

796
00:48:56,663 --> 00:48:58,756
Clamp it down.
Watch your time, Independence team.

797
00:48:58,832 --> 00:49:01,426
Thanks, Harry. Would you mind
lettin' me run my own team?

798
00:49:01,501 --> 00:49:04,629
- You're gonna blow the tranny. Slow it down, baby.
- Take it easy, Bear.

799
00:49:04,704 --> 00:49:07,104
Just relax.
She can handle it.

800
00:49:07,173 --> 00:49:11,166
A.J., you're at 600 feet. Your pipe is
long. Let's back the R.P.M. S down to 8,000.

801
00:49:11,244 --> 00:49:14,475
- We don't have time for 8,000!
- A.J., take it back down.

802
00:49:14,547 --> 00:49:16,845
You're gonna snap the pipe.
I don't wanna blow this transmission.

803
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:19,044
- Damn it, 11,000.
- Slow it down, A.J.

804
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,485
Bear, come on. Get on
our team for a little bit.

805
00:49:21,554 --> 00:49:23,545
Oh, space cowboy.

806
00:49:23,623 --> 00:49:26,387
- Harry, are you listenin' to this?
- Yeah, I'm listenin', Bear.

807
00:49:26,459 --> 00:49:29,860
You don't work for Harry anymore, okay?
Out there, you gotta listen to me.

808
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:32,524
When we're on that rocket,
you gotta do what I say.

809
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:34,328
I'm throttling up
to another 1,000.

810
00:49:34,401 --> 00:49:36,995
A.J., back it off.
You're gonna blow the transmission.

811
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:39,971
Hey, Harry, would you let me
run my team, please?

812
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,565
- R.P.M. S are at red line.
- Bear, goddamn it, I know what I'm doing.

813
00:49:42,642 --> 00:49:44,803
Come on. She can handle this.
She'll be fine. Trust me.

814
00:49:44,878 --> 00:49:48,541
- A.J., back down.
- The number one transmission is down.

815
00:49:48,615 --> 00:49:52,574
Oh, son of a...
The computer's wrong, and you know that.

816
00:49:52,652 --> 00:49:55,382
- We did the right thing.
- We're gonna restart the simulation.

817
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,686
If you wanna replace a member
of the crew, now is the time.

00:49:58,758 --> 00:50:02,319
I'll take care of this.
Get him out of the tank, Chick.

819
00:50:05,765 --> 00:50:09,064
- You wanna go home? Is that it? You wanna be fired?
- No, I don't.

820
00:50:09,135 --> 00:50:11,330
- My crew was doing the right thing.
- Your crew?

821
00:50:11,404 --> 00:50:13,565
- Yeah.
- Your crew just blew the transmission, A.J.!

is just playin' it safe.

- I got it!

828
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:34,350
- I want my men to have tomorrow night off.
- What do you mean "off"?

829
00:50:34,427 --> 00:50:38,295
I mean, off. Out of here. For at least
ten hours. Then we'll go to Kennedy.

830
00:50:38,365 --> 00:50:40,299
Well, there's no possible way
we can do that, Harry.

831
00:50:40,367 --> 00:50:42,801
There's a potentially huge
security risk. What if they talk?

832
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:45,963
- What if they get hurt?
- What if they're too burnt out to do the right thing?

833
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:48,530
What if they get up there, and they
forget what they're fighting for?

834

They got pulled off the street.

the last night they ever see Earth.

to let 'em spend it with their families.

cracker qualifies as a cracker.

- Well, 'cause it's sweet, which to me suggests cookie.

01:24:09,574 --> 01:24:12,304
You boys got those wills
filled out correctly?

1318
01:24:27,825 --> 01:24:31,283
All right, men, this is what
we trained for. Now just suck it up!

1319
01:24:31,362 --> 01:24:34,195
On the mark. Five. Four.

1320
01:24:34,265 --> 01:24:36,859
Three. Two. One.

1321
01:24:47,412 --> 01:24:50,006
- Is this supposed to be like this?
- Don't worry. This is normal.

1322
01:24:50,081 --> 01:24:52,015
How would you know?
[Groaning]

1323
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:54,517
- Fourteen thousand miles an hour.
- Four Gs.

1324
01:24:54,585 --> 01:24:57,748
- Ahh! - How long does
this last? - Six Gs.

1325
01:25:00,792 --> 01:25:04,057
- Fifteen thousand. - Really
heavy, man! - This isn't normal.

1326
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:06,528
- What do you mean, "this isn't normal"?
- This is way worse!

1327
01:25:06,597 --> 01:25:08,758
Eight Gs. Hang tight!

1328
01:25:08,833 --> 01:25:13,361
We're not gonna make it!
Oh, we're gonna die!

1329
01:25:13,438 --> 01:25:15,702
Twelve minutes. Flight,
we still got nothin' here.

1330
01:25:15,773 --> 01:25:19,607
- [All Groaning]
- This is too fast!

1331
01:25:23,881 --> 01:25:27,817
- Ten Gs!

[Exhales]

1336
01:25:51,275 --> 01:25:54,904
We have acquisition of signal
from Independence and Freedom.

1337
01:25:54,979 --> 01:25:58,415
- [Relieved Chattering]
- We're in, guys. All right. Welcome back, team.

1338
01:25:58,483 --> 01:26:00,815
We have visual of the target, Houston.

1339
01:26:09,894 --> 01:26:12,260
You see that?

1340
01:26:16,467 --> 01:26:20,528
- Wow.
- [Computer Blipping]

1341
01:26:20,605 --> 01:26:24,132
- Come in, Independence.
- [Sharp] Houston, you gotta see this to believe it.

1342
01:26:27,111 --> 01:26:30,740
Okay, team, let's take 'em in. Okay,
Quincy, how much tail debris do we have?

1343
01:26:30,815 --> 01:26:33,010
[Man] Freedom, turn on FOD radar.

1344
01:26:33,084 --> 01:26:35,752
- FOD radar on.
- [Blipping]

1345
01:26:35,885 --> 01:26:40,481
Everybody, hang on. This could get
a little rough. Engaging evasive radar.

1346
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:50,589
Hold on!

1347
01:26:59,776 --> 01:27:03,041
Goddamn! We got debris!

1348
01:27:04,647 --> 01:27:07,013
[Watts]
We're dumping auxiliary boosters.

1349
01:27:20,396 --> 01:27:23,490
- Houston, do you read me?
- We got debris!

1350
01:27:26,302 --> 01:27:31,638
We're goin' in! We're comin' in hot!

1351
01:27:31,707 --> 01:27:35,040
Independence, try to maintain your
present heading. You've got a target L.Z.

1352
01:27:35,111 --> 01:27:38,308
- There's too much debris! We gotta peel off!
- Negative!

1353
01:27:40,283 --> 01:27:42,843
- [Loud Crashing]
- We're hit!

1354
01:27:45,988 --> 01:27:49,048
- Mayday, mayday!
- I've lost main thrusters. Get 'em back up!

1355
01:27:49,125 --> 01:27:51,491
Mayday, Houston, mayday!
We've lost R.C.S. Thrusters!

1356
01:27:51,561 --> 01:27:55,588
Mayday, Freedom, mayday! We are
out of control! We are going down!

1357
01:27:55,665 --> 01:27:58,031

Everybody, go to your own life support!
Lock yourself in the cargo bay!

1361
01:28:28,831 --> 01:28:33,859
We are going down! Houston! Houston,
we are going down! We have lost control!

1362
01:28:33,936 --> 01:28:36,564
I can't get it on!

1363
01:28:38,007 --> 01:28:41,340
- Good luck, Freedom.
- Oh, my God, this is it.

Is that the Independence?

1368
01:29:40,469 --> 01:29:43,927
[Sharp] Houston, Independence is
a dead stick. They're not gonna make it.

1369
01:29:56,886 --> 01:29:59,377
Houston, Independence has gone down.

1370
01:30:11,367 --> 01:30:13,835
When I touch this baby down,
full reverse thrust.

Hang tight! Hang tight!

1373
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:24,271
Houston, we overshot our landing field.
We overshot our landing field.

1374
01:30:24,347 --> 01:30:26,338
Oh, no!

sure we can still get off this rock.

1381
01:31:07,723 --> 01:31:11,716
Our electrical system is screwed.
I'm going to back-up. Fuel seals check.

1382
01:31:11,794 --> 01:31:15,821
- Engine seals check. Pressure seals check.
- Oh, God. Oh!

- Anyone hurt?
- [Panting] Where's...

1384
01:31:23,339 --> 01:31:27,469
Where's the other shuttle?
What happened to the other shuttle?

1385
01:31:27,543 --> 01:31:30,671
- Independence is off the grid.
- "Off the grid"?

What are you, a freakin' cyborg?
What does that mean?

Hey, you saw it yourself, right?

1388
01:31:36,318 --> 01:31:38,286
They're gone.

- Let's just ask God to take care of our friends.

- We got eight hours.
- [Gasps]

1395

Nothin'.

1397
01:32:12,555 --> 01:32:15,854
Come on, Watts, Sharp, somebody.

1398
01:32:15,925 --> 01:32:18,792
This is CAPCOM Houston.

1399

This is CAPCOM Houston.

1402
01:32:33,175 --> 01:32:36,110
All right, let's get the tools
unpacked and fire up the Armadillo.

1403
01:32:36,178 --> 01:32:39,306
- We're not getting a damn thing on the inertial nav system.
- I know where we are.

1404
01:32:39,381 --> 01:32:42,179
Please step away.
Radio signal's dead.

1405
01:32:42,251 --> 01:32:44,185
I'm flipping the backup generator.

1406
01:32:44,253 --> 01:32:46,653
Radio signal's gonna be cut in half
till we get main power back.

1407
01:32:46,722 --> 01:32:52,251
We're in segment 202, lateral grid 9,
site 15H-32, give or take a few yards.

1408
01:32:52,328 --> 01:32:57,163

- How the hell do you know that?

1409
01:32:57,233 --> 01:33:00,999
- Because I'm a genius.
- The gauges will not read.

1410
01:33:01,070 --> 01:33:03,698
They're all peaked, like
we're plugged into some magnetic field.

01:33:03,772 --> 01:33:06,297
- Well, who on this spaceship wants to know why?
- [Sharp] By all means.

1412
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:08,843
The reason we were shooting
for grid 8 is because...

1413
01:33:08,911 --> 01:33:12,074
thermographics indicated that
grid 9 was compressed iron ferrite.

1414
01:33:13,482 --> 01:33:16,383
Which means that you landed us
on a goddamn iron plate.

1415
01:33:19,889 --> 01:33:22,323
All right. Well, you heard the man.
Let's wheel out the remote satellite link.

1416
01:33:22,391 --> 01:33:26,463
- We need that radio.
- Oh, God, please tell me we still got one of 'em.

Oh, God!

Hello! Anyone!

1424
01:34:26,589 --> 01:34:31,185
Is anyone else alive?
Somebody, help me!

1425
01:34:32,962 --> 01:34:35,795
A.J.!

1426
01:34:35,865 --> 01:34:39,096
- Where are you?
- I'm here.

[Grunting]

1428
01:34:42,338 --> 01:34:46,274
Lev, there's no one else.

1429
01:34:46,342 --> 01:34:49,311
- There's no one else.
- I know.

1430
01:34:49,379 --> 01:34:52,007
[Bear] Oh, man.

1431
01:34:52,081 --> 01:34:55,141
- [A.J.] Bear, where are you?
- [Bear] A.J.? A.J.?

1432
01:34:56,686 --> 01:34:59,621
- [Bear] I'm in the shuttle, man.
- [Grunts]

1433
01:34:59,689 --> 01:35:03,648
- Are you all right?
- I'm so glad to see you, man.

1434
01:35:03,726 --> 01:35:07,753
I never thought I'd be so happy
to see your ugly face.

1435
01:35:07,830 --> 01:35:12,096
- Houston, do you read? This is Freedom.
- [Sharp] Check your thrusters.

1436
01:35:12,168 --> 01:35:15,934
- [Watts] Houston, do you copy?
- [Sharp] Is everyone good to go?

1437
01:35:25,949 --> 01:35:27,883
Wow.

1438
01:35:37,226 --> 01:35:41,322
[Harry] Down here! In the valley!

1439
01:35:41,397 --> 01:35:44,161
This place is like
Dr. Seuss's worst nightmare.

1440
01:35:44,233 --> 01:35:49,193
Let's get the remote satellite.
We'll get better reception up there.

1441
01:35:49,272 --> 01:35:52,571
[Harry] Bring Max down.
Watch yourself through here, Max.

1442
01:35:52,642 --> 01:35:56,009
- There're a couple big fissures.
- To the left!

1443
01:35:56,079 --> 01:35:59,344
Bring it to the left!

1444
01:36:02,652 --> 01:36:05,780
[Harry] Rockhound, you come on down here
and take some readings down in the flat spot.

1445
01:36:05,855 --> 01:36:09,814
- [Beeping]
- Iron ferrite.

1446
01:36:13,563 --> 01:36:18,091
- I have fire.
- [Harry] Watts, I'm comin' back. Stand by.

1447
01:36:18,167 --> 01:36:22,160
- Mostly iron, Rockhound.
- God, I hate knowing everything.

1448
01:36:22,238 --> 01:36:25,230
We couldn't have picked
a worse spot to drill.

1449
01:36:25,308 --> 01:36:29,301
Well, I can pretty much guarantee
it's not gonna be thicker than 50 feet.

1450
01:36:29,379 --> 01:36:32,314
- How do you figure that?
- 'Cause if it is, we're screwed.

1451
01:36:34,651 --> 01:36:37,279
- Max, you good?
- Yeah. Just makin' hole.

1452
01:36:37,353 --> 01:36:40,584
- Turn it around.
- [Max] Friggin' outer space.

1453
01:36:42,725 --> 01:36:44,818
It's good.

1454
01:36:51,701 --> 01:36:55,330
All right. We're in. Another light.
We're cuttin' through pretty good.

1455
01:36:55,405 --> 01:36:58,841
There's some stuff in here
I ain't never seen.

1456
01:36:58,908 --> 01:37:01,968
- All right, let's punch it down!
- [Metal Creaking]

1457
01:37:02,045 --> 01:37:05,572
- Hey, Harry, did you see that?
- Yeah, Max, I see it. I see it. What is it?

1458
01:37:05,648 --> 01:37:07,912
- We lost the bite in the bit.
- All right. Back it off. Back it off.

1459
01:37:07,984 --> 01:37:10,248
Goddamn it!

1460
01:37:10,319 --> 01:37:14,847
Sounds like we twisted a shank. Back it out
of there, Max. Good. Good. Hold 'er there.

1461
01:37:18,194 --> 01:37:22,028
Wow, this is a goddamn Greek tragedy.

1462
01:37:22,098 --> 01:37:26,194
- We've all seen broken drill heads before.
- Not after ten feet.

1463
01:37:26,269 --> 01:37:29,261
- I never seen one.
- Well, now you've seen one.

1464
01:37:29,338 --> 01:37:31,772
- What do you want?
- Unpack the Judge.

1465
01:37:34,243 --> 01:37:36,438
[A.J.] Bear, Lev.

1466
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:39,811
[Lev]
We're only three astronauts left now.

1467
01:37:39,882 --> 01:37:43,716
[A.J.] We're not astronauts. We're oil
drillers. We're not even supposed to be here.

1468
01:37:43,786 --> 01:37:46,983
What? You're not astronaut?

1469
01:37:47,056 --> 01:37:49,354
I'm getting us outta here. Get in.

1470
01:37:49,425 --> 01:37:51,893
- Why?
- Just get in the Armadillo. I have an idea.

1471
01:37:51,961 --> 01:37:54,327
Houston, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?

1472
01:37:54,397 --> 01:37:56,957
Houston, do you copy?
Freedom shuttle has...

1473
01:37:57,033 --> 01:38:00,400
- [Radio Static Hissing]
- We're gettin' some scattered video feeds here.

1474
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:03,735
[Watts]
Houston, this is Freedom. Do you copy?

1475
01:38:03,806 --> 01:38:06,366
- Thank God we have you, Freedom.
- Freedom, this is Houston. Go ahead.

1476
01:38:06,442 --> 01:38:09,377
- Don't lose 'em, Malloy.
- Sharp, I'm getting something.

1477
01:38:09,445 --> 01:38:12,437
- Houston, this is Freedom. We have landed safely.
- Where are they?

1478
01:38:12,515 --> 01:38:14,881
We are at site coordinates
approximately 15H-32...

1479
01:38:14,951 --> 01:38:16,942
- Okay, I want to know everything we can about that location.
- Got it.

1480
01:38:17,019 --> 01:38:19,817
- Get it before we lose 'em.
- We're also having electric and antenna difficulties.

1481
01:38:19,889 --> 01:38:23,484
- Walter, get Mechanical on that.
- But we have commenced drilling.

1482
01:38:23,559 --> 01:38:26,289
- Stevens, we're losin' him. Bring it up on four. On four.
- Come on.

1483
01:38:26,362 --> 01:38:29,263
Shuttle flight capability not yet known.

1484
01:38:29,332 --> 01:38:31,459
- Bump the signal. -
Bumping. - Houston. Houston.

1485
01:38:31,534 --> 01:38:34,367
We lost 'em. Get 'em back.
Gruber, we need that hookup.

1486
01:38:36,472 --> 01:38:39,032
Show you how we do things
where I come from.

1487
01:38:47,183 --> 01:38:49,515
- Hold on!
- [Metal Crumpling]

1488
01:38:57,493 --> 01:38:59,518
Seat it.

1489
01:38:59,595 --> 01:39:02,792
All right, get ready.
Max, thread it.

1490
01:39:04,433 --> 01:39:07,596
Guys, the clock is tickin'.
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

1491
01:39:07,670 --> 01:39:10,400
All right! Good! Crank it loose!

1492
01:39:10,473 --> 01:39:13,101
Keep it at 25. Let's kick
a little asteroid butt!

1493
01:39:13,176 --> 01:39:15,201
All right, Chick. Give me
more torque on the turbine, huh?

1494
01:39:15,278 --> 01:39:18,076
- [Drill Whining]
- [Harry] Max, I need some more power down here!

1495
01:39:18,147 --> 01:39:20,615
- All right, boss.
- Throw it in fourth, then drop the hammer.

1496
01:39:20,683 --> 01:39:23,277
- Let's drill through this turd.
- [Harry] Come on, boys.

1497
01:39:23,352 --> 01:39:28,221
We gotta hop. We're fallin' behind.
Dig, dig, dig. Chew this iron bitch up.

1498
01:39:28,291 --> 01:39:32,990
[Metal Whining]

1499
01:39:33,062 --> 01:39:34,996
- Chick, the tranny's stuck.
- Harry!

1500
01:39:35,064 --> 01:39:38,124
- What is it?
- Chick, come on! Help!

1501
01:39:38,201 --> 01:39:40,362
- Release the clutch!
- Pull it up!

1502
01:39:40,436 --> 01:39:43,303
Okay. Well, this thing's not movin'.

1503
01:39:43,372 --> 01:39:45,636
No, no, no! Shut it down! Shut it...

1504
01:39:47,810 --> 01:39:52,679
[Groaning]

1505
01:39:52,748 --> 01:39:55,478
This is not workin' out, Harry.

1506
01:39:55,551 --> 01:40:00,488
- Oh, are you all right?
- Oh, blew the tranny. Blew the tranny.

1507
01:40:00,556 --> 01:40:03,525
Come on, God.

1508
01:40:03,593 --> 01:40:07,029
Just a little help.
That's all I'm askin'.

1509
01:40:07,096 --> 01:40:09,564
I think we're close enough.
He might've heard ya.

1510
01:40:13,336 --> 01:40:16,533
Here's the bad news. Before
the asteroid passed the moon,

1511
01:40:16,606 --> 01:40:18,938
her rotation was stable
at 32 degrees on an x axis.

1512
01:40:19,008 --> 01:40:23,576
But now look at this. The lunar
gravity's put her in a spin.

1513
01:40:23,645 --> 01:40:27,012
She's tumbling on all three axes.
This wasn't expected, sir.

1514
01:40:27,082 --> 01:40:29,812
- What does this do for communications?
- Not good.

1515
01:40:29,885 --> 01:40:33,116
We'll have definite contact with
the shuttle for only seven more minutes.

1516
01:40:33,188 --> 01:40:34,985
- After that it's radio darkness.
- For how long?

1517
01:40:35,057 --> 01:40:38,390
And after seven minutes,
we may never hear from them again.

1518
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:41,020
But we're trying
to bounce a signal...

1519
01:40:41,096 --> 01:40:43,564
off a Russian military satellite,
reestablish contact that way.

1520
01:40:43,632 --> 01:40:48,035
If we lose the shuttle com, when do we lose
the ability to remote detonate that nuke?

1521
01:40:48,103 --> 01:40:50,697
The weapon remote receives a signal
from a Milstar satellite.

1522
01:40:50,773 --> 01:40:52,707
Higher orbit, more powerful transmitter.

1523
01:40:52,775 --> 01:40:57,212
If we've got the shuttle for seven minutes,
we can remote detonate for an additional five.

1524
01:40:57,279 --> 01:40:59,304
What he's trying to say, General,
is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time,

1525
01:40:59,381 --> 01:41:03,078
you may lose the ability
to detonate the nuke... permanently.

1526
01:41:03,152 --> 01:41:05,279
I've got to inform the president.

1527
01:41:05,354 --> 01:41:09,313
Just want to make sure you know
we're stuck on an asteroid.

1528
01:41:09,391 --> 01:41:11,325
- Do you know what you're doing now?
- No, no.

1529
01:41:11,393 --> 01:41:14,624
You know what? I have no idea
what I'm doing. I have no idea.

1530
01:41:14,696 --> 01:41:16,960
This button... I don't know
what that does, okay?

1531
01:41:17,032 --> 01:41:19,626
All I know is that
we just crashed back there,

1532
01:41:19,701 --> 01:41:22,602
I lost two of my friends,
we're 25 miles from Harry's shuttle.

1533
01:41:22,671 --> 01:41:26,198
We don't know if he's alive. We don't know if
he can fly. All I know is, there's a beep...

1534
01:41:26,275 --> 01:41:28,505
on this thing and I'm
trying to get us there.

1535
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:36,684
[Beeping]

1536
01:41:36,752 --> 01:41:39,812
Let's get it unpacked.

1537
01:41:39,888 --> 01:41:43,585
- What's up?
- We're drilling through some kind of metal I've never seen before.

1538
01:41:43,659 --> 01:41:46,628
It's fried two of our drill bits,
and now we blew our first transmission.

1539
01:41:46,695 --> 01:41:49,630
- So how deep are we?
- We could use your help with the transmission, Colonel.

1540
01:41:49,698 --> 01:41:52,633
I have an assessment report due now.
We're supposed to be at 200 feet.

1541
01:41:52,701 --> 01:41:55,761
- So how deep are we?
- Not as deep as we'll be...

1542
01:41:55,838 --> 01:41:58,500
when you quit askin' me these questions
and help us load this transmission on.

1543
01:41:58,574 --> 01:42:02,066
- What is our current depth?
- Our current depth is not important, Colonel.

1544
01:42:02,144 --> 01:42:04,772
I'll decide what's important.
We've got 800 feet to drill.

1545
01:42:04,847 --> 01:42:07,816
You've had two and a half hours.
Where are we?

1546
01:42:09,685 --> 01:42:11,676
We're at 57 feet.

1547
01:42:11,753 --> 01:42:15,689
Now, if you're not too busy, maybe you
can give us a hand with this transmission.

1548
01:42:15,757 --> 01:42:20,990
Colonel Sharp! Get this strapped up.
I'll be right back. Colonel Sharp!

1549
01:42:21,063 --> 01:42:24,123
All right. I'm coming through.
We have contact. Over.

1550
01:42:24,199 --> 01:42:27,134
That's as clear as it's gonna get.

1551
01:42:27,202 --> 01:42:29,500
Houston, this is Freedom. Do you copy?

1552
01:42:29,571 --> 01:42:33,803
Working at a remote satellite link
at this moment. Transmission change.

1553
01:42:33,876 --> 01:42:36,538
- Colonel!
- Twenty minutes. Puts drilling final at ten hours.

1554
01:42:36,612 --> 01:42:40,378
Please advise. That's four hours
past the zero barrier. Please advise.

1555
01:42:40,449 --> 01:42:43,418
What the hell is this? "Zero depth"?

1556
01:42:43,485 --> 01:42:46,113
And where'd this come from?
Who are you talkin' to? Is that Truman?

1557
01:42:46,188 --> 01:42:50,648
Lemme have that phone. Gimme the phone. Truman!
Look, this is what happens when you drill.

1558
01:42:50,726 --> 01:42:54,787
We cannot use your "U.S. Air Force
Personnel Only" drill time card.

1559
01:42:54,863 --> 01:42:57,559
- Who wrote this thing, by the way?
- We're losing coms again.

1560
01:42:57,633 --> 01:42:59,601
Look... Is he getting this? Does he
hear me or... What's wrong with this?

1561
01:42:59,668 --> 01:43:02,364
- The com's down.
- What do you mean, "the com's down"?

1562
01:43:02,437 --> 01:43:04,769
[Sharp] What do I mean? I mean we've
lost communication to mission control.

1563
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:07,536
Fine. Let's go back to the cargo bay
and get the transmission...

1564
01:43:07,609 --> 01:43:10,339
Harry, guess what. You had your shot.
You didn't do it. You understand me?

1565
01:43:10,412 --> 01:43:15,008
- You can't...
- Why don't you stay here... [Shouting]

1566
01:43:15,083 --> 01:43:19,076
Write a report, why don't ya?
That'll be... [Shouting Continues]

1567
01:43:19,154 --> 01:43:21,179
My men and I will go
and get this hole dug!

1568
01:43:21,256 --> 01:43:25,056
You and your men are the biggest
mistake in the history of NASA.

1569
01:43:26,962 --> 01:43:29,988
- [Man] We've lost communication.
- Oh, God.

1570
01:43:32,734 --> 01:43:37,569
- We're not lookin' too good right now.
- No shit.

1571
01:43:37,639 --> 01:43:40,267
We gotta get that radio back up.

1572
01:43:42,210 --> 01:43:45,236
[Man] Mr. President,
it's time to make a decision.

1573
01:43:45,314 --> 01:43:50,081
We can remote detonate the bomb
for only another five minutes.

1574
01:43:50,152 --> 01:43:55,852
- [Rings]
- Yes? Kimsey here. Yes, Mr. President.

1575
01:43:55,924 --> 01:43:57,892
Yes, we saw that too, sir.

1576
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:00,861
But maybe we should wait until they...

1577
01:44:07,803 --> 01:44:10,966
Dan, get them out of there.

1578
01:44:11,039 --> 01:44:13,974
- Evac right now.
- What's goin' on here?

1579
01:44:14,042 --> 01:44:16,203
I've been ordered
to override the system.

1580
01:44:16,278 --> 01:44:20,908
[Elevator Bells Dinging]

1581
01:44:20,983 --> 01:44:23,349
Well, what is this?

1582
01:44:27,522 --> 01:44:30,184
Secondary protocol.

1583
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:37,523
But they haven't drilled
the damn hole yet!

1584
01:44:42,437 --> 01:44:44,598
The president's advisors feel
that the drilling isn't working.

1585
01:44:44,673 --> 01:44:46,470
And we've lost radio contact,
maybe for good.

1586
01:44:46,541 --> 01:44:49,567
We've only got a few minutes left of
guaranteed ability to remote detonate that nuke.

1587
01:44:49,644 --> 01:44:52,545
If we don't do it now we could lose
control, and we may never get it back.

1588
01:44:52,614 --> 01:44:55,549
Well, you tell the president that
he better fire his so-called advisors.

1589
01:44:55,617 --> 01:44:59,018
If you detonate that nuke on the
surface, we waste a perfectly good bomb,

1590
01:44:59,087 --> 01:45:01,146
and we have one chance
to save this planet!

1591
01:45:01,223 --> 01:45:03,350
[Beeping]

1592
01:45:12,067 --> 01:45:17,437
- I need that radio. Gruber, give me everything you got now!
- [Gruber] Roger that.

1593
01:45:21,243 --> 01:45:24,542
Yes, Mr. President, I understand that
completely, but my point is very, very simple.

1594
01:45:24,613 --> 01:45:27,138
And I think you need to trust me on this
because I know something about it.

1595
01:45:27,215 --> 01:45:30,309
I guarantee you,
if you do this, you kill us all.

1596
01:45:34,056 --> 01:45:36,354
Yes, sir.

1597
01:45:36,425 --> 01:45:38,689
General, he wants you.

1598
01:45:40,796 --> 01:45:43,856
This is Kimsey. Yes, sir.

1599
01:45:43,932 --> 01:45:46,423
I understand.

1600
01:45:48,503 --> 01:45:51,438
The orders are

You have not told them yet!

1602
01:45:55,143 --> 01:45:57,668
That is my father up there!

1603
01:45:57,746 --> 01:46:01,113
This is one order you shouldn't
follow, and you fucking know it!

1604
01:46:01,183 --> 01:46:03,879
Let her go. Let her go!

1605
01:46:05,020 --> 01:46:07,147
Your key, sir.

- [Consoles Beeping]
- God be with them.

1607
01:46:13,861 --> 01:46:16,557
Slow it down.

Harry...

1611
01:46:25,673 --> 01:46:29,234
the clock on that
nine-foot nuclear weapon is ticking.

1612
01:46:30,611 --> 01:46:34,047
Oh, my God! Sharp!
Get back here now!

1613
01:46:35,449 --> 01:46:37,679
What? Get the shuttle ready to evac now!

1614
01:46:37,752 --> 01:46:40,414
- It just came on all by itself. What the hell's happening?
- Secondary protocol.

1615
01:46:40,488 --> 01:46:42,456
- What's that? What?
- Secondary protocol.

1616
01:46:42,523 --> 01:46:44,320
- What does that mean?
- What the hell's secondary protocol?

1617
01:46:44,391 --> 01:46:46,291
- They're detonating this thing from Earth.
- What do you mean, detonating?

1618
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:48,157
- We haven't even drilled the hole yet!
- We'll drop it in the hole.

1619
01:46:48,229 --> 01:46:50,322
- What're you talkin' about? - The hole?
Whoa, whoa! - Get your helmets on now!

1620
01:46:50,397 --> 01:46:53,423
- Oh, no, no. How-How you turn it off?
- I got two men out on that rock!

1621
01:46:53,501 --> 01:46:55,833
I got a man out there too.
We gotta evac now.

1622
01:46:55,903 --> 01:46:57,837
Max, Rockhound, get back
to the shuttle, double-time!

1623
01:46:57,905 --> 01:47:00,840
- They could be on their way here.
- They're not on their way here.

1624
01:47:00,908 --> 01:47:03,672
They would've talked to us
by now. We would've seen them.

1625
01:47:03,744 --> 01:47:06,907
- Watts, air lock the cockpit now!
- I copy you.

1626
01:47:06,981 --> 01:47:10,280
- Max, Rockhound!
- Hey, wait a minute! How do you turn this thing off?

1627
01:47:10,351 --> 01:47:13,787
- [Radio Static Hissing] - Harry,
do you copy? - Somethin's wrong.

1628
01:47:13,854 --> 01:47:16,584
Yeah, it's all wrong, man.
We shouldn't even be up here.

1629
01:47:16,657 --> 01:47:18,682
I know. Let's go back to the ship!

1630
01:47:18,759 --> 01:47:21,421
I'm not leavin' without my men, Sharp.

1631
01:47:21,495 --> 01:47:24,692
We've got two and a half minutes
to drop it and get off this rock.

1632
01:47:24,765 --> 01:47:27,097
If they're not back by the time
we finish, we leave without 'em.

1633
01:47:27,168 --> 01:47:29,602
Okay, let's simplify this.
Let's just turn the bomb off right now.

1634
01:47:29,670 --> 01:47:32,503
If we don't put this bomb down
in a hole 800 feet onto a fault line,

1635
01:47:32,573 --> 01:47:34,803
all you're gonna have is
a real expensive fireworks show.

1636
01:47:34,875 --> 01:47:37,435
This is turnin' into
a surrealistic nightmare here.

1637
01:47:37,511 --> 01:47:39,945
Watsler, are you listening? It's Truman.

1638
01:47:40,014 --> 01:47:44,007
Okay, listen to me carefully.
I want you to kill it. Kill the uplink.

1639
01:47:55,496 --> 01:47:59,159
- Give us the time, Sharp. Shut this bomb down now!
- It's not my call.

1640
01:47:59,233 --> 01:48:01,929
- Then whose call is it?
- An order to detonate can only come from the president.

1641
01:48:02,002 --> 01:48:03,902
- The president's not here! You've gotta give us more time!
- Let's just turn it off now.

1642
01:48:03,971 --> 01:48:05,996
I'm telling you
to shut this bomb down now!

1643
01:48:06,073 --> 01:48:08,041
- And I'm telling you it's not my call!
- Well, guess what.

1644
01:48:08,108 --> 01:48:10,941
- I just made the call for you.
- Harry!

1645
01:48:12,213 --> 01:48:16,047
Don't. You could set it off.

1646
01:48:16,116 --> 01:48:19,813
Oh, man. What're you doin'
with a gun in space?

1647
01:48:22,823 --> 01:48:27,658
Come on. Come on. We gotta stop
that bomb right now. Kill the uplink.

1648
01:48:27,728 --> 01:48:33,030
- This thing is gonna blow. We gotta get it off the ship.
- Easy.

1649
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:38,504
- Stand down, Sergeant.
- Shut this bomb down and let us finish our job the right way.

1650
01:48:38,572 --> 01:48:40,699
I'm under orders to protect
a surface detonation.

1651
01:48:40,774 --> 01:48:44,972
I'm gonna give you three seconds to shut this
bomb down, and then I'm gonna make you shoot me.

1652
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:48,612
Hurry, Watsler.
For Christ's sake, hurry.

1653
01:48:50,885 --> 01:48:53,513
- [Detonator Powering Down]
- What happened?

1654

- Aah!
- [Grunting]

1655

Sir, the override...
It's been overridden.

01:49:03,163 --> 01:49:06,690
I bought us a couple of minutes, so get
that radio workin', okay? Hurry, hurry!

[Grunting]

1658
01:49:08,802 --> 01:49:12,966
Bring me all the way up here just to
blow me and my friends up? Is that it?

1659
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:15,201
- [Gasping] Listen...
- Shut up!

1660
01:49:15,276 --> 01:49:19,713
Shut up, Colonel.
I'm talking now.

1661
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:22,908
[Sharp] It could start again.
It might've been a warning.

1662
01:49:22,983 --> 01:49:24,917
- [Gasping]
- Uh-oh.

1663
01:49:24,985 --> 01:49:27,453
That's why you are gonna
dismantle this bomb.

1664
01:49:27,521 --> 01:49:30,490
All right. What'd we miss?

1665
01:49:34,261 --> 01:49:37,162
- Do it again.
- Go.

1666
01:49:39,633 --> 01:49:41,567
Keep tryin'.

1667
01:49:44,104 --> 01:49:49,007
Sir, I need you to cease and desist.
I need your terminal... now.

1668
01:49:51,845 --> 01:49:55,178
- They're reactivating the bomb.
- Comin' back on-line, sir.

1669
01:49:55,249 --> 01:49:58,184
- [Detonator Blipping]
- Oh, geez. Here we go again.

1670
01:49:58,252 --> 01:50:01,517
What're you doin' up here? And why did
you even bother to make the trip?

1671
01:50:01,588 --> 01:50:04,557
To do the right thing,
to see that it's done.

[Gasping]

1674

For God's sakes,
think about what you're doin'.

1675
01:50:14,168 --> 01:50:18,298
Why are you listenin' to someone
that's 100,000 miles away?

1676
01:50:18,372 --> 01:50:22,468
We're here.
Nobody down there can help us.

1677
01:50:22,543 --> 01:50:26,240
So if we don't get this job
done, then everybody's gone.

1678
01:50:26,313 --> 01:50:28,645
One minute.

01:50:28,716 --> 01:50:31,583
I've been drillin' holes
in the earth for 30 years.

1680
01:50:31,652 --> 01:50:36,385
And I have never, never missed
a depth that I have aimed for.

1681
01:50:36,457 --> 01:50:39,858
And by God, I am not gonna miss
this one. I will make 800 feet.

1682
01:50:39,927 --> 01:50:45,490
- Forty-two seconds. - But I can't do
it alone, Colonel. I need your help.

1683
01:50:45,566 --> 01:50:49,662
You swear on your daughter's life,
on my family's,

1684
01:50:49,737 --> 01:50:51,671
that you can hit that mark?

1685
01:50:51,739 --> 01:50:56,767
I will make 800 feet.
I swear to God, I will.

1686
01:50:56,844 --> 01:50:59,836
Then let's turn this bomb off.

have to do. Get 'em off backwards.

Have we lost complete radio contact?

bouncing off Russian and French satellites.

But you think this is
looking good, or what?

02:04:24,218 --> 02:04:27,016
[Watts]
Houston, drilling has recommenced.

1889
02:04:27,087 --> 02:04:30,614
Do you think they can drill
250 feet in an hour?

1890
02:04:30,691 --> 02:04:32,716
They better.

1891
02:04:32,793 --> 02:04:35,455
Bring that piece on in, Bear.

1892
02:04:35,529 --> 02:04:38,225
Tractor pull.

1893
02:04:38,299 --> 02:04:41,632
- I'm comin' down!
- We got 250 feet to go.

1894
02:04:41,702 --> 02:04:44,796
It's our last transmission,
last drill head.

1895
02:04:44,872 --> 02:04:48,899
Punch it through.
First gear. We got contact.

1896
02:04:48,976 --> 02:04:53,941
- Come on down, A.J.
- [Grunting] I got this, man. Let's go!

1897
02:04:54,014 --> 02:04:57,973
Lev, the right engine hub. Houston, I'm
getting no response from the preflight sequence.

1898
02:04:58,051 --> 02:05:01,646
[Muffled] Come on, now.
This is not... Hey... Hey, come here.

1899
02:05:01,722 --> 02:05:05,783
Can you get me outta here,
please, Lev? Thank you. [Grunting]

1900
02:05:05,859 --> 02:05:09,124
- Ow! Jesus! Hey!
- Wait. Uh, shh, shh.

1901
02:05:09,196 --> 02:05:11,664
- [Watts] Lev, the right engine...
- Okay.

1902
02:05:11,732 --> 02:05:14,724
Lemme outta here, will ya? Just tryin'
to have some fun before I die!

1903
02:05:14,801 --> 02:05:18,430
- How deep are we?
- Seven seventy.

1904
02:05:21,241 --> 02:05:23,675
[Grunting]

1905
02:05:23,744 --> 02:05:25,871
- Whoa, they got problems.
- The gauges are spiking.

1906
02:05:25,946 --> 02:05:28,039
Methane! Shut it down! Back it down!

1907
02:05:28,115 --> 02:05:32,176
I can't pull back now. The bit'll
get lodged. We don't have enough time!

1908
02:05:32,252 --> 02:05:36,052
Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's gonna blow!
It's how we lost Max!

1909
02:05:36,123 --> 02:05:39,957
I know what I'm talkin' about. We can punch
through this. We can knock this outta the park.

1910
02:05:40,027 --> 02:05:41,858
This is our last transmission, A.J.

1911
02:05:41,928 --> 02:05:44,089
Goddamn it, if you're ever
gonna trust me, ever,

1912
02:05:44,164 --> 02:05:46,997
once in your life, trust me now!

1913
02:05:47,067 --> 02:05:51,436
- Harry, it's gonna blow!
- Harry, I know what I'm doin'. You just gotta trust me.

1914
02:05:52,806 --> 02:05:54,740
Make the call.

1915
02:05:56,677 --> 02:05:59,111
All right. Hold on.
I'm pushin' through her.

1916
02:06:03,784 --> 02:06:05,718
[Grunting]

1917
02:06:05,786 --> 02:06:07,913
I'm pushin' through her!

1918
02:06:07,988 --> 02:06:11,583
- What's your depth?
- Seven seventy-five. Seven eighty.

1919
02:06:11,658 --> 02:06:14,422
Take it up, baby! Ram it home!

1920
02:06:14,494 --> 02:06:16,587
[Grunts] Drive on down, A.J.!

1921
02:06:16,663 --> 02:06:19,325
Seven eighty-five. Come on. Come on.

1922
02:06:19,399 --> 02:06:22,459
- Come on, A.J.! - Punch
it! - Ninety-one. Come on.

1923
02:06:22,536 --> 02:06:25,733
Seven ninety-two. Seven ninety-five!

1924
02:06:25,806 --> 02:06:28,434
Drive it down, A.J.!

1925
02:06:28,508 --> 02:06:31,033
Seven ninety-seven! Ninety-nine!

1926
02:06:31,111 --> 02:06:34,410
- Breakthrough!
- Eight hundred! Eight-oh-two, Harry!

1927
02:06:34,481 --> 02:06:36,449
- Yeah!
- We did it!

1928
02:06:36,516 --> 02:06:39,917
- [All Cheering]
- Yes! - We did it!

1929
02:06:39,986 --> 02:06:44,116
- Yeah! Kid, way to go!
- I knew it, baby!

1930
02:06:44,191 --> 02:06:48,127
- It's not over till we get the bomb down that hole.
- Watts, they've got 38 minutes.

1931
02:07:08,415 --> 02:07:10,349
[Sharp]
Harry, you've gotta give me that hole.

1932
02:07:10,417 --> 02:07:14,114
I'm gonna need two more minutes.
I got a bent pipe jammed in the hole.

1933
02:07:14,187 --> 02:07:16,883
We gotta cut it out before
we can send that bomb down. A.J.!

1934
02:07:16,957 --> 02:07:19,391
- She good to go?
- Yeah, I'm all set.

1935
02:07:19,459 --> 02:07:21,893
All right.

1936
02:07:21,962 --> 02:07:23,896
[Grunts]

1937
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:29,060
- All right.
- [Harry] A.J., come on! Make it fast!

1938
02:07:29,136 --> 02:07:32,435
I'm goin' as fast as I can!
There's a lot of gas pressure!

1939
02:07:37,911 --> 02:07:39,845
You feel that?

1940
02:07:39,913 --> 02:07:42,746
Harry, you gotta give me that hole.
The bomb is almost ready.

1941
02:07:42,816 --> 02:07:45,307
- [Harry] Pull that pipe out!
- Harry, I'm almost through!

1942
02:07:45,385 --> 02:07:48,183
- Give me 15 more seconds!
- [Rumbling]

1943
02:07:52,225 --> 02:07:54,921
Well, this is somethin' new.

1944
02:07:54,995 --> 02:07:58,055
- [Crashing]
- I don't think this thing likes us.

1945
02:07:58,131 --> 02:08:01,965
- That's 'cause it knows we're here to kill it.
- Whoa!

1946
02:08:06,406 --> 02:08:09,000
Hey, what's goin' on up there?

1947
02:08:12,879 --> 02:08:16,872
- A.J.!
- What the hell was that?

1948
02:08:16,950 --> 02:08:20,044
- A.J.!
- Goddamn it, I'm finished!

1949
02:08:21,655 --> 02:08:24,317
- A.J., you all right?
- Oh, lot of gas pressure in here, man!

1950
02:08:24,391 --> 02:08:27,224
- Get me out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hydrogen pocket!

1951
02:08:27,294 --> 02:08:29,888
Aah!

1952
02:08:36,269 --> 02:08:38,237
Whoa!

1953
02:08:41,641 --> 02:08:44,007
- [Grunts]
- Aah!

1954
02:08:44,077 --> 02:08:47,774
Oh! Harry! Pull me in!

1955
02:08:49,149 --> 02:08:53,586
- [Grunting]
- Aah! A.J., hang on!

1956
02:08:53,653 --> 02:08:56,247
[Grunting]

1957
02:08:59,259 --> 02:09:01,955
Secure the bomb!

1958
02:09:02,028 --> 02:09:04,826
Sharp, heads up!

1959
02:09:04,898 --> 02:09:08,026
Gruber! Get outta there now!

1960
02:09:08,101 --> 02:09:10,399
- [Asteroids Shrieking]
- Oh, no.

1961
02:09:16,977 --> 02:09:20,378
[Whimpering]
Oh, God, no!

1962
02:09:20,447 --> 02:09:23,575
[All Screaming]

1963
02:09:25,752 --> 02:09:28,346
Look out!

1964
02:09:30,857 --> 02:09:34,384
Help! Oh, no!

1965
02:09:34,461 --> 02:09:38,591
[Screaming]

1966
02:09:38,665 --> 02:09:41,725
[Panting]

1967
02:09:41,801 --> 02:09:44,736
- Do you believe that just happened?
- [Gas Hissing]

1968
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:49,736
- Sharp, you all right?
- I'm okay.

1969
02:09:49,809 --> 02:09:52,004
- Bear?
- Yeah. I'm here, Harry.

1970
02:09:52,078 --> 02:09:54,603
- A.J.?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1971
02:09:54,681 --> 02:09:58,447
- [Gas Hissing]
- We lost Gruber.

1972
02:09:59,753 --> 02:10:02,051
Gruber's dead.

1973
02:10:02,122 --> 02:10:04,590
Let's get that bomb ready
and go home.

1974
02:10:12,566 --> 02:10:14,966
- [Sharp] Oh, my God.
- [Beeping]

1975
02:10:15,035 --> 02:10:19,335
- Is there a problem, Colonel?
- The timer, the remote, the whole thing's dead.

1976
02:10:19,406 --> 02:10:21,499
What, the bomb is dead?

1977
02:10:21,575 --> 02:10:26,171
No, the trigger's dead. It must've
gotten damaged during the rock storm.

1978
02:10:27,247 --> 02:10:29,272
So how do we detonate it?

1979
02:10:39,426 --> 02:10:44,227
We have 18 minutes to zero barrier.
We got some bad news.

1980
02:10:44,297 --> 02:10:48,063
The remote detonator
on the bomb has been damaged.

1981
02:10:48,134 --> 02:10:51,035
That means that somebody's
gonna have to stay behind.

1982
02:10:53,607 --> 02:10:55,939
It takes two people
to fly this thing.

1983
02:10:56,009 --> 02:11:00,173
Either we all stay and die,
or you guys draw straws.

1984
02:11:00,246 --> 02:11:04,774
I say we all stay and die.
But that's me.

1985
02:11:04,851 --> 02:11:09,379
I'll draw. Let's draw.

1986
02:11:09,456 --> 02:11:12,892
Nobody's gonna draw straws.

1987
02:11:12,959 --> 02:11:15,553
- I'll stay and take care of it.
- Well, I can't live with that sort of thing.

1988
02:11:15,629 --> 02:11:17,790
- Nobody asked you if you could live with it, all right?
- Bullshit!

1989
02:11:17,864 --> 02:11:20,492
No way I will let you
volunteer for this...

1990
02:11:20,567 --> 02:11:24,298
so I can go back to my home country
like the man who didn't volunteer.

1991
02:11:24,371 --> 02:11:26,305
No way!

1992
02:11:26,373 --> 02:11:31,072
Hey, man, let's draw, and let's see
who's gonna stay up here and dance.

1993
02:11:31,144 --> 02:11:33,578
Guys, I-I-I know you guys
think I'm crazy right now,

1994
02:11:33,647 --> 02:11:36,514
but I would really like
this responsibility.

1995
02:11:36,583 --> 02:11:39,051
All right. All right.

1996
02:11:39,119 --> 02:11:43,180
- I can do it.
- Let's just draw straws and get it over with. Come on.

1997
02:11:43,256 --> 02:11:44,991
I ain't drawin' against you, Harry.

1998
02:11:45,124 --> 02:11:49,060
Well, I'm gonna draw against you, Chick,
so you better just go ahead and do it.

1999
02:11:49,128 --> 02:11:51,358
Just gimme this thing.

2000
02:11:58,137 --> 02:12:00,731
Is this good or bad?

2001
02:12:05,811 --> 02:12:08,644
Oh, man.

2002
02:12:08,714 --> 02:12:12,343
Well, we all gotta die, right?

2003
02:12:15,688 --> 02:12:18,020
I'm the guy who gets
to do it saving the world.

2004
02:12:18,090 --> 02:12:22,186
So, uh, let's go.
We-We got about ten minutes, right?

2005
02:12:24,030 --> 02:12:26,021
You plug this into the port.

2006
02:12:26,098 --> 02:12:31,331
Lift, press, hold. That's it.

2007
02:12:31,404 --> 02:12:34,862
Lift, press, hold. Shouldn't be
too tough. Even I can't screw this up.

2008
02:12:34,940 --> 02:12:37,602
I'll take him down.

2009
02:13:11,510 --> 02:13:14,240
Do me a favor, will ya?

2010
02:13:14,313 --> 02:13:17,476
Just tell Grace that, uh...

2011
02:13:17,550 --> 02:13:20,280
that I'll always be with her, okay?

2012
02:13:22,488 --> 02:13:24,422
Can you do that?

2013
02:13:25,991 --> 02:13:28,118
Yeah. Okay, kid.

2014
02:13:34,166 --> 02:13:36,259
Give this to Truman.

2015
02:13:36,335 --> 02:13:40,465
Make sure Truman gets that.
Get in there.

2016
02:13:45,444 --> 02:13:47,639
It's my turn now.

2017
02:13:47,713 --> 02:13:50,682
[Gasping] Harry! Harry!

2018
02:13:50,749 --> 02:13:55,982
You can't do this to me! It's my job!

2019
02:13:56,055 --> 02:14:01,152
You go take care of my little girl now.
That's your job.

2020
02:14:04,230 --> 02:14:06,357
Always thought of you as a son.

2021
02:14:06,432 --> 02:14:08,400
Always.

2022
02:14:08,467 --> 02:14:12,164
But I'd be damn proud
to have you marry Grace.

2023
02:14:12,238 --> 02:14:15,969
- Harry.
- You take care of yourself.

2024
02:14:16,041 --> 02:14:18,066
- Harry, no!
- I love you, pal.

2025
02:14:18,144 --> 02:14:21,079
Harry, I love you!
Don't, Harry! Wait a minute!

2026
02:14:21,147 --> 02:14:23,707
- My son.
- Don't do this, Harry!

2027
02:14:23,782 --> 02:14:26,376
Don't do this! Harry!

2028
02:14:34,727 --> 02:14:37,719
What happened?

2029
02:14:37,796 --> 02:14:39,696
That crazy, stubborn son of a...

2030
02:14:42,067 --> 02:14:44,865
[Grunting]

2031
02:14:46,005 --> 02:14:48,940
Well, this was a real good idea.

2032
02:14:49,008 --> 02:14:53,240
All right, let's go, Sharp.
Let's get our team outta here.

2033
02:14:58,150 --> 02:15:03,087
Come on! Let's get ready
to initiate thrusters! Let's go!

2034
02:15:03,155 --> 02:15:05,783
- Strap it in, guys!
- Get the O2 masks.

I didn't want to be like you.
