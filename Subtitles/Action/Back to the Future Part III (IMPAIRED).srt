Perhaps the gigawatt discharge

162
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,240
Quick!

163
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,920
What's wrong?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

164
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,080
You're not far off, Doc.

165
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,600
Great Scott!

166
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,720

167
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,480
"Died September 7, 1885."
That's one week after you wrote the letter!

168
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,720
"Erected in eternal memory
by his beloved Clara."

169
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,240
Who the hell is Clara?

170
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,000
-Please don't stand there!
-Right. Sorry.

DOC: "Shot in the back by Buford Tannen
over a matter of $80"?

173
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,800
What kind of a future do you call that?

174
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,240
MARTY:
"Buford Tannen was a notorious gunman...

175
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,040
"...whose short temper and a tendency to drool...

176
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,920
"...earned him the nickname 'Mad Dog.'

177

"He was quick on the trigger
and bragged he had killed 12 men...

178
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,200
"...not including Indians or Chinamen."

179
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,960
DOC: Does it name me? Am I one of the 12?
MARTY: Wait.

180
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,400
"This claim cannot be proven
since precise records were not kept...

181
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,320
"...after Tannen shot a newspaper editor...

182
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,800
"...who printed an unfavorable story
about him in 1884."

183
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,200
MARTY: That's why we can't find anything.
DOC: Look.

184
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,320
DOC: William McFly and family.
Your relatives?

185
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,400
MARTY: My great-grandfather's name
was William. That's him. Good-Iooking guy.

186
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,160
DOC: McFlys, but no Browns.

187
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,720
Maybe it was a mistake.
Maybe that grave wasn't yours.

188
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,040
There could've been
another Emmett Brown in 1885.

189
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,080
Did you have any relatives here back then?

190
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,120
The Browns didn't come to Hill Valley
until 1908. Then they were the von Brauns.

191
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,560
My father changed our name
during World War I.

192

Great Scott, it's me!

Then it is true, all of it.

196
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,400
It is me who goes back there and gets shot.

197
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,640
It's not gonna happen, Doc.

198
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,440
After you fix the time circuits
and put new tires on the DeLorean...

199
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,800
...I'm going back to 1885,
and I'm bringing you home.

200
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,400
DOC: The clothes fit?

201
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,000
MARTY: Everything except the boots.
They're kind of tight.

202
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,360
Are you sure this stuff is authentic?

203
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,280
Of course.
Haven't you ever seen a Western?

204
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,120
Yeah, I have.

205
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,280
Clint Eastwood never wore anything like this.

206
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,080
-Clint who?
-Right. You haven't heard of him yet.

207
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,720
You have to wear the boots.

208
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,600
You can't wear those futuristic things
back in 1885.

209
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,800
You shouldn't be wearing them
here in 1955.

210
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,240
-As soon as I get there, I'll put them on.
-Okay.

211
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,800
I think we're about ready.
I put gas in the tank.

212
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,520
Your future clothes are packed.

213
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,320
Just in case,
fresh batteries for your walkie-talkies.

214
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,760
What about that floating device?

215
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,960
MARTY: Hoverboard.
DOC: All right.

216
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,400
It's gonna be a long walk
back to Hill Valley from here.

217
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,320
It's still the safest plan.

218
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,200
We can't risk sending you back
into a populated area...

219
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,480
...or to a spot that's geographically unknown.

220
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,760
You don't want to crash into some tree
that existed in the past.

221
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,040
This was all completely open country...

222
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,880
...so you'll have plenty of runout space
when you arrive.

223
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,680
Remember, where you're going,
there are no roads.

224
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,840
There's a small cave over there which will be
a good place to hide the time vehicle.

225
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,240
The new time-circuit control tubes
are warmed up.

226
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,360
Time circuits on.

227
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,320
I wrote the letter on September 1,
so we'll send you to...

228
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,840
...September 2, that's a Wednesday.
September 2, 1885, 8:00 a.m.

229
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,840
I get shot on Monday the 7th.
You have five days to locate me.

230
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,680
According to my letter, I'm a blacksmith,
so I probably have a shop somewhere.

231
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,880
All you got to do is drive the time vehicle...

232
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,160
...directly toward that screen,
accelerating to 88 miles an hour.

233
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,320
MARTY: Wait a minute.

234
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,680
If I drive straight towards the screen,
I'll crash into those Indians.

DOC:
Marty, you're not thinking fourth dimensionally.

236
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,600
You'll instantly be transported to 1885
and those Indians won't even be there.

237
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,320
Right.

-I apologize for the crudity of this model...
-Yeah, it's not to scale. It's okay.

626
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,560
All right. Tomorrow night, Sunday...

627
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,360
...we load the DeLorean
onto the tracks here, on the spur...

628
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,200
...by the abandoned silver mine.

629
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,080
The switch track is where the spur runs
off the main line...

630
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,440
...three miles out to Clayton... Shonash Ravine.

631
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,320
The train leaves the station
at 8:00 Monday morning.

632
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,920
We'll stop it, uncouple the cars,
throw the switch track and then hijack...

633
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,560
...borrow the locomotive and use it
to push the time machine.

634
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,280
According to my calculations we'll reach
88 mph just before we hit...

635
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,240
...the edge of the ravine,
at which point we'll be transported back to 1985...

636
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,920
...and coast safely across the completed bridge.

637
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,200
What does this mean? "Point of no return."

638
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,200
That's our fail-safe point.

639
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,160
Till there, we have time to stop the locomotive
before it plunges into the ravine.

640
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,440
But once we pass this windmill,
it's the future or bust.

I hope I'm not disturbing anything.

We were just doing a little model railroading.

660
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,600
When my bags were thrown from the wagon...

661
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,880
...my telescope was damaged.

662
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,000
Since you mentioned an interest in science...

663
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,000
...I thought you might be able to repair it for me.

I would pay you, of course.

CLARA:
I think a lens may be out of alignment because...

668
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,840
...if you move it this way the image turns fuzzy.

See?

00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,960
But if you turn it the other way...

...then...
