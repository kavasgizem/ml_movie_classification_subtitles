- I'm sorry.

Now some scholars insist
that it never happened...

797

perfectly in keeping with a king
who was also a psychopathic killer.

799

It's the Sword of Alexander.

in '98 on the black market.

Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.

But we managed to stop the water.

1266
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:04,838
We saved the farm.

1267
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:09,312
Your grandma baked me a cake.
Said I was a hero.

1268
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:15,799
Later that day we found out
we blocked the water all right.

1269
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,319
We sent it upstream.

1270
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,715
The whole Lang farm washed away.

1271

their horses were drowning.</i>

1272

1273

Did the nightmares ever stop?

1274
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,639
Yeah.

1275
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:42,591
When I met your mother.

1276
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:47,438
She gave me faith that
there's good in this world.

I miss you too, Dad.

1280
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:24,832
ALFRED: You know you can't win this.

1281
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:28,152
It's suicide.

1282
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:34,316
I'm older now than my father ever was.

1283
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,232
This may be the only thing
I do that matters.

1284
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,879
20 years of fighting criminals
amounts to nothing?

1285
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:46,600
Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.

1286
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:49,513
Pull one up, another grows in its place.

1287
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,873
This is about the future of the world.

1288
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:56,672
This is my legacy.

1289
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:00,271
My father sat me down right here.

1290
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:02,192
Told me what Wayne Manor was built on.

1291
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:05,989
Railroads, real estates, and oil.

1292
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:09,630
The first generation made their fortune
trading with the French.

1293
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:11,392
Pelts and skins.

1294
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:16,992
They were hunters.

1295
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:36,159
