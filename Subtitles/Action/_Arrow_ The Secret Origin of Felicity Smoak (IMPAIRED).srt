So it occurred
to me this morning,

43
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:08,461
what's the one thing
that Queen Consolidated has

44
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:10,163
that we don't use
to its maximum potential?

46
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,066
Have you heard of a process
called cogeneration?

00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:16,302
I haven't even looked
at a cup of coffee yet.

48
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:19,405
Well, cogeneration is--
The repurposing

49
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:22,208
of waste heat given
off by electricity production.

50
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,810
Exactly. It's a principle
of thermodynamic efficiency,

51
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:26,579
which occurred to me
could be applied to a building

52
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:29,348
which generates over
240,000 watts of electricity.

Mm-hmm.

55
00:02:31,786 --> 00:02:34,320

preliminary calculations

energy back to the city?

If by "sell" you mean "give away
for free," then yes.

59
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,497

SCPD just dispatched
a riot squad

323
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,376
to Starling
National.

324
00:13:45,378 --> 00:13:47,344
It's like fighting a fire
with gasoline.

325
00:13:47,346 --> 00:13:49,380
Suit up.

326

[All yelling]

00:13:52,852 --> 00:13:55,252
[Siren]

328
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:59,390
This group is ordered
to disperse!

329
00:13:59,392 --> 00:14:01,459
[All yelling]
Back!

330
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:03,227
Back behind the line!

331
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:06,396
Felicity: Oliver, the riot is getting
out of control.

332
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:08,332
You need to hurry up.

333
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:11,368
Back! Back
behind the line!

334
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,710
Get away
from the bank!

00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:28,619
[All yelling]

336
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,459
The teargas is dispersing them,
but we can't calm

337
00:14:35,461 --> 00:14:37,060
the entire city,
Felicity.

338
00:14:37,062 --> 00:14:38,462
The trace led me
to the virus they're using.

339
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:41,098
It is a mile past complex.

340
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,967
I'm combing through now.

341
00:14:43,969 --> 00:14:45,936
No, no, no, no, no, no!

342
00:14:45,938 --> 00:14:47,504
What's wrong?

343
00:14:47,506 --> 00:14:50,173
The virus...
I can't stop it!

344
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:52,309
- How do you know?
- Because it's mine.

345
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:56,713
I wrote it five years ago.

346
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:07,830
Ok, ok, before
you say anything,

347
00:15:07,831 --> 00:15:10,533
just know that I never imagined
the virus being used

348
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,433
for something like this.
I mean, sure,

349
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:13,969
I could have
imagined it.

350
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,370
I actually have
a very vivid imagination.

351
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,038
Like cronuts!
I had a vision of them before--

352
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,207
Hey.

353
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,242
Relax.

354
00:15:21,244 --> 00:15:23,244
Take a deep breath.

355
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:26,147
Good.

356
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:27,815
Now start at the beginning.

357
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:29,384
I was in this,

358
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,019
I guess you could
call it a group,

359
00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:34,022
in college.
We were "hacktivists."

360
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:36,624
For lack
of a better word.

361
00:15:36,626 --> 00:15:38,593
Civil disobedience

362
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:41,896
via the World Wide Web.

363
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:44,665
I created this.

364
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,901
This...

365
00:15:46,903 --> 00:15:49,704
Super virus.

366
00:15:49,706 --> 00:15:51,773
That could give us
root access

367
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:54,042
to any infected server.

368
00:15:54,044 --> 00:15:56,144
We could expose
government fraud

369
00:15:56,146 --> 00:15:57,412
and start
virtual sit-ins

370
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,881
and digitally
deface criminals.

371
00:15:59,883 --> 00:16:03,351
I guess you could say it was
my first attempt at being a hero.

372
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:06,687
Felicity. [Sighs]

373
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:08,790
Why didn't you tell me
about any of this?

374
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:12,527
Do we even know
a fraction

375
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:14,662
of what happened to you the five years
that you were away?

376
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:17,131
Who else had access
to the program?

377
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:19,667
Myron Forest.
He was my...

378
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:21,736
I had a boyfriend
in college,

379
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:23,571
and Myron
was his roommate.

380
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:25,606
And he was a member
of this hacktivist group?

381
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:27,208
What about the boyfriend?

382
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,544
Oh, he couldn't
have done this.

383
00:16:29,546 --> 00:16:31,779
He's...not
in the picture,

384
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:33,881
but Myron always had
somewhat of an edge.

385
00:16:33,883 --> 00:16:36,217
Can you get me an address?

386
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:38,619
Sure.

387
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:44,492
Just one small problem--

388
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:46,360
not small,
necessarily, but short.

389
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:48,729
Just take
the alleyway entrance.

390
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:51,332
Ok.

391
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:10,751
Are you ok?

392
00:17:10,753 --> 00:17:12,420
[Chuckles]

393
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:13,855
I've been better.

394
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:16,157
I talked it over with Myron,

395
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:19,093
and I'm going to tell them
I wrote the super virus.

396
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:21,062
You can't do that.

397
00:17:21,064 --> 00:17:23,764
I can't let you
rot in prison, Coop.

398
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:26,033
You can't tell them
you wrote that virus...

399
00:17:26,035 --> 00:17:28,269
'Cause I already
told them I did.

400
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:29,904
Cooper...

401
00:17:29,906 --> 00:17:32,640
I always said I'd protect you
from the grues.

402
00:17:32,642 --> 00:17:35,576
- This isn't--
- It's better this way.

403
00:17:35,578 --> 00:17:37,845
I wiped out
those loans.

404
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:40,381
There's no reason
both of us should be in prison.

405
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,118
I love you.

406
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,686
Love you, too.

407
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:59,901
Hey. Got a minute?

408
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,873
Congratulations,
you called in a riot squad,

409
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,976
you nearly started one!
And! You did it behind my back.

410
00:18:08,978 --> 00:18:10,678
You were busy,

411
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,813
and the situation
at Starling National was escalating.

412
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:14,415
You escalated it, Laurel!

413
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:16,817
Please tell me you can
at least see that now.

414
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:18,619
Ok.

415
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:20,888
I'm sorry.

What's gotten into you?

418
00:18:25,862 --> 00:18:28,729
You're angry, you're distant,
you're reckless.

419
00:18:28,731 --> 00:18:30,298
Tell me you're not
boozing again.

420
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,300
No.

421
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:34,659
Then what the hell's going on?
Because this isn't you.

422
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,477
Look, I haven't said anything
because I was hoping

423
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:38,006
 that you would say something,

424
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:40,341
because you, sweetheart,
you are in ten different kinds of pain,

425
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:43,177
and you won't talk about it.

426
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:46,080
I can't talk
about it with you.

427

Ok.

428
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:55,289
But listen, you don't have
to talk about it with me.

429
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,857
But talk about it
with somebody.

keeps that locked.

Or...so they told me.

stupid door to open.

What are you
doing here, Ollie?

A super hacker is trying to take over
the city and I'm worried about you.

440
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:35,062
I still get to be worried,
right?

441
00:19:35,064 --> 00:19:36,664
Yes.

442
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,766
And if you
really have to,

443
00:19:38,768 --> 00:19:40,868
you can even be
judgmental--

444
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,204
occasionally.

445
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:45,039
Someone told me
recently

446

that a family is
pretty precious.

447
00:19:47,944 --> 00:19:51,045
And love,
in spite of everything,

448
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:52,613
is what makes it
precious.

449
00:19:52,615 --> 00:19:56,350
Right now, the Queen family
is just you and me.

450
00:19:56,352 --> 00:19:59,320
So let it just be you and me.

451
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:03,090
And don't take Merlyn's money.

I'm trying to meet you
halfway here, Ollie.

is up to you.

to shut down the virus.

the cyber attacks?

of expletives!

484
00:21:37,487 --> 00:21:38,719
We need
to track down

485
00:21:38,721 --> 00:21:40,421
whoever Myron shared
your code with.

486
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:42,490
I hacked all of his emails
and all his text messages

487
00:21:42,492 --> 00:21:44,225
from five years ago
and all I got was depressed.

488
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:46,660
Ok. What
about your ex?

489
00:21:46,662 --> 00:21:48,529
I already told you,
he didn't do it.

490
00:21:48,531 --> 00:21:50,931
Why? Because he's
your ex-boyfriend?

491
00:21:50,933 --> 00:21:52,533
Because...

492
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:55,803
My senior year of college,

493
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:58,139
Cooper and I did
a stupid thing.

494
00:21:58,141 --> 00:22:01,809
He got arrested
and he went to prison.

495
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:04,745
So he went to prison.
Maybe he got out.

496
00:22:04,747 --> 00:22:06,013
He didn't.

497
00:22:06,015 --> 00:22:09,083
How do you know?
Because he's dead.

498
00:22:11,254 --> 00:22:13,888
He hung himself
before sentencing.

499
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,456
[Exhales]

500
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,191
Felicity, I...

501
00:22:18,361 --> 00:22:21,762
I just really need to be
alone right now.

502
00:22:30,673 --> 00:22:34,041
Ah. I'm glad
you're here.

503
00:22:34,043 --> 00:22:35,309
When I launched
my plan to rebrand

504
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:36,944
Starling
into Star City,

505
00:22:36,946 --> 00:22:40,614
I didn't count on
cyber terrorism.

506
00:22:40,616 --> 00:22:42,716
I'm looking
for a partner

507
00:22:42,718 --> 00:22:44,318
with whom
to drown my sorrows

508
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,886
and you definitely

509
00:22:45,888 --> 00:22:48,656
look like someone
who could use a drink.

510
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,692
I'm sorry.

511
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:54,528
My mother...

512
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:57,331
I didn't have
anywhere else to go.

513
00:22:58,534 --> 00:23:01,502
You ok?

514
00:23:03,473 --> 00:23:05,139
You're an inventor.

515
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:07,374
Did you ever create

516
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:10,211
anything that you didn't
think was important,

517
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:12,012
turns out,

518
00:23:12,014 --> 00:23:14,548
it's very important?

519
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,517
Of course.

520
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:19,386
Those turn out to be
the best inventions.

521
00:23:19,388 --> 00:23:20,988
Not always.

522
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,857
You want to talk about it?

523
00:23:26,162 --> 00:23:28,229
Of course
I'd find you here.

524
00:23:28,231 --> 00:23:31,532
Could you just wait one second?
Wait?

525
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:33,801
[Scoffs] I'm sorry;

526
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:35,769
I've already waited two hours for you
at your apartment,

527
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:37,838
and before that,
it was two hours in the club.

528
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,074
[Sighs]

529
00:23:40,076 --> 00:23:43,377
Is there any way that you could be
anywhere else but here?

530
00:23:49,085 --> 00:23:51,685
Thanks, Mom.

531
00:23:51,687 --> 00:23:54,421
That wasn't
the least bit mortifying.

532
00:23:54,423 --> 00:23:57,291
Only half as bad as parents'
week in freshman year.

533
00:23:57,293 --> 00:23:59,159
Oh, I'm sorry.

534
00:23:59,161 --> 00:24:03,330
I'm sorry I've been reduced to stalking
my own daughter.

535
00:24:03,332 --> 00:24:06,100
Because you can't
seem to comprehend

536
00:24:06,102 --> 00:24:07,902
that I can't make
the whole world stop

537
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:11,005
because you decided to
show up on my doorstep.

538
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:13,007
I have responsibilities!

539
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:14,842
Yes, I know, Felicity.

540
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:16,744
You have work.
You have work, work, work, work.

541
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,579
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

542
00:24:18,581 --> 00:24:21,315
It is so much more
than work.

543
00:24:21,317 --> 00:24:23,250
But all you care about
it my love life

544
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:25,286
or how much cleavage
I don't show.

545
00:24:25,288 --> 00:24:26,420
That is not true!

546
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:28,455
That is completely true!

547
00:24:28,457 --> 00:24:30,724
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I'm terminally single.

548
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:32,493
I'm sorry I have
an actual job.

549
00:24:32,495 --> 00:24:34,228
I'm sorry that I don't
dress like a porn star!

550
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,696
Which I realize is
a compliment to you.

551
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:37,765
So I'm so sorry
that I am such

552
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,600
a disappointment to you!

553
00:24:43,472 --> 00:24:45,973
I'm not as smart
as you, Felicity,

554
00:24:45,975 --> 00:24:47,207
or your father.

555
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:49,376
I know that.

556
00:24:49,378 --> 00:24:53,213
Even when you were only six years old,
I could barely keep up with you two.

557
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:55,316
And...

558
00:24:55,318 --> 00:24:57,918
Maybe I wasn't always
the mother you wanted,

559
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,653
but I was always there.

560
00:24:59,655 --> 00:25:01,922
I stayed and I tried.

561
00:25:01,924 --> 00:25:04,491
He...

562
00:25:04,493 --> 00:25:07,494
He left me.

563
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:10,998
He left us.

564
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,535
But when I look at you,

565
00:25:14,537 --> 00:25:17,404
all I see
is what he gave you.

566
00:25:17,406 --> 00:25:19,607
There is nothing of me...

567
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:22,710
In you.

568
00:25:22,712 --> 00:25:25,079
You know,
it's so funny. I was--

569
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:27,948
I was always so afraid
that one day,

570
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,385
you were going to leave me,
too. [Chuckles]

571
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,924
But now I finally realize...

572
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:39,960
You already did.

573
00:25:57,073 --> 00:25:59,741
There are people on the other end
of this thing, right?

574
00:25:59,743 --> 00:26:01,042
People we can hit?

575
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:02,443
We need Felicity.

576
00:26:02,445 --> 00:26:04,479
I'm here.

577
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:08,283
The super virus
has 3,407 traceable access notes.

578
00:26:08,285 --> 00:26:11,252
Hopefully I didn't
put a firewall in every one, though.

579
00:26:11,254 --> 00:26:13,855
Of course I did, because
I'm smarter than that.

580
00:26:13,857 --> 00:26:15,790
Seriously, if I had
two less IQ points,

581
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:17,458
we never would have
gotten in this mess.

582
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,027
Are you all right?

583
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:20,929
- Where's your mom?
- I don't know.

584
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:23,331
Probably back
at my place,

585
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,034
wishing she had a different daughter.
It's a long story.

586
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:28,069
So go see her.
Take an hour.

587
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:29,470
The city
is under attack.

588
00:26:29,472 --> 00:26:31,739
You're our best chance
of stopping it,

589
00:26:31,741 --> 00:26:33,141
but not like this, Felicity.
Your head's not in the game.

590
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:34,576
I will get it
together.

591
00:26:34,578 --> 00:26:36,945
Your tracer hack's running.
Take an hour.

592
00:26:36,947 --> 00:26:39,247
Go talk to your mom.

593
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:41,716
I do not have anything
to say to her.

594
00:26:41,718 --> 00:26:43,985
You know, earlier today,
Thea told me

595
00:26:43,987 --> 00:26:46,688
that she literally
has to put up with me

596
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,856
because family is precious.
And that it's love,

597
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:51,459
in spite of everything,

598
00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:54,028
that makes it precious.

599
00:26:55,165 --> 00:26:57,932
Go.

600
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:09,210
Where's Sara?

601
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:11,212
The nanny came
to pick her up.

602
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,448
Said he was from a company
called A.R.G.U.S.

603
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,816
I don't know,
I've never heard of it.

604
00:27:14,818 --> 00:27:17,619
I think
that's the point.

605
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:19,387
Well, I'm glad
you're still here.

606

[Scoffs]

607
00:27:20,857 --> 00:27:24,158
You are a terrible liar,
Felicity.

608
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:29,263
Might be the only thing
we have in common.

609
00:27:29,265 --> 00:27:30,999
I have blonde hair.

610
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:33,568
You dye it.

611
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,336
You're right.

612
00:27:35,338 --> 00:27:37,205
We're different,

613
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:39,540
and it's always going to be that way.
And it's not easy--

614
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:41,576
No, you know
what, it's--

615
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:45,046
it's totally my fault
for just showing up here uninvited.

616
00:27:45,048 --> 00:27:47,015
Seriously. I think
I just got so excited

617
00:27:47,017 --> 00:27:49,083
about this free flight.

618
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,409
What?

619
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,174
My plane ticket.

620
00:27:52,198 --> 00:27:54,997
I got an email that said
I'd won some contest.

621
00:27:55,525 --> 00:27:59,227
Free first class
round trip to Starling.

622
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:01,329

to be here.

- Baby!

00:28:24,587 --> 00:28:25,653
I'm ok.
Oh!

Felicity Smoak, just the woman
I wanted to see.

636
00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:38,733
What the hell
do you want from me?!

637
00:28:38,735 --> 00:28:39,867
Who are you?

638
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:41,569
You really don't know?

639
00:28:45,775 --> 00:28:48,943
I thought you'd never
forget your first love.

640
00:28:57,377 --> 00:29:00,278
You died.

641
00:29:01,096 --> 00:29:02,195
They told me--

00:29:02,197 --> 00:29:03,863
That I committed
suicide, right?

643
00:29:03,865 --> 00:29:06,633
The NSA needed a hacker with game
for cyber espionage,

644
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:08,368
and I needed
to not be in prison

00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,203
for the rest of my life.

646
00:29:10,205 --> 00:29:11,638
Because of what the NSA
wanted me doing,

647
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,742
it was...advantageous
for me to be dead.

648
00:29:15,744 --> 00:29:17,677
When I found out you died,

649
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,180
I was devastated.

650
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:22,082
I loved you.

651
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:24,251
I loved you, too.

652
00:29:24,253 --> 00:29:26,253
After I finished my time
with the NSA,

653
00:29:26,255 --> 00:29:28,188
I was going to find you.

654
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,290
To let you in on this.

655
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:31,858
And then I discovered
you'd become this

656
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,327
corporate lap dog.

657
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:37,497
Broke my heart.
You changed.

658
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:39,366
If you ever thought I was capable
of doing something like this,

659
00:29:39,368 --> 00:29:41,067
you never really
knew me at all.

660
00:29:41,069 --> 00:29:42,669
When you wrote this
virus, Felicity,

661
00:29:42,671 --> 00:29:45,338
you knew exactly
what it was capable of.

662
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,274
All I'm doing is unleashing
the true potential

663
00:29:47,276 --> 00:29:48,408
of what you made.

664
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,643
Why?!

665
00:29:49,645 --> 00:29:51,544
This isn't who you are!

666
00:29:51,546 --> 00:29:53,446
Five years with the NSA,

667
00:29:53,448 --> 00:29:55,315
you learn a lot about
how the world works.

668
00:29:55,317 --> 00:29:58,018
How we can't be saved
or salvaged.

669
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,953
How it's every man
for himself.

670
00:29:59,955 --> 00:30:02,722
You also learn that when
a city bank goes under,

671
00:30:02,724 --> 00:30:04,891
say, financial
cyber attack,

672
00:30:04,893 --> 00:30:08,628
the mayor will reach out
to the Treasury Department

673
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,097
and request an influx
of fresh cash.

674
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:13,933
Cash which is transported
by armored trucks

675
00:30:13,935 --> 00:30:16,636
navigating according to
a closed-end GPS system,

676
00:30:16,638 --> 00:30:19,806
which directs them
to City Deposit.

677
00:30:19,808 --> 00:30:21,641
If the drivers
deviate from the route,

678
00:30:21,643 --> 00:30:25,312
the trucks are shut down.

679
00:30:25,314 --> 00:30:27,580
But you're going to hack
into the system

680
00:30:27,582 --> 00:30:31,117
and direct the cash
to come here.

681
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,752
It was about money,
and I'm the sell-out?

682
00:30:32,754 --> 00:30:33,920
No.

683
00:30:33,922 --> 00:30:36,356
No, babe.

684

You're the one who's
going to help me.

my capabilities.

688
00:30:43,198 --> 00:30:45,365
I'm going to politely decline.

I just had an A.R.G.U.S. agent

694
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:01,815
I could have them go back,
check things out.

Yep.

00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,700
Don't train for that.

809
00:38:08,702 --> 00:38:10,368
All right,
train for yourself.

810
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,738
See, now I know
how to teach you.

811
00:38:16,009 --> 00:38:19,444
So what's it
going to be?

812
00:38:19,446 --> 00:38:21,046
Red or black?

813
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,614
Black.

814
00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:24,749
Definitely black.

815
00:38:35,696 --> 00:38:38,096
It was popcorn,
right?

816
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:40,699
You said you were
meeting me halfway.

817
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:42,701
This is me
doing my part.

818
00:38:51,745 --> 00:38:54,779
I missed you, Speedy.

819
00:38:57,784 --> 00:39:00,986
Let's not miss
each other anymore.

820
00:39:00,988 --> 00:39:04,422
I mean, it was so much easier
to be in each other's lives

821
00:39:04,424 --> 00:39:06,358
when we were
underneath the same roof.

822
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,861
So...Why don't you
move in with me?

823
00:39:09,863 --> 00:39:13,131
I mean, clearly I
have enough space.

824
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:14,799
And I...

825
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:18,503
I swear once the club starts
making a profit,

826
00:39:18,505 --> 00:39:21,806
I will donate all
of Malcolm's money

827
00:39:21,808 --> 00:39:24,376
to an earthquake relief

828
00:39:24,378 --> 00:39:26,811
charity thing.

829
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,748
I can live with that.

830
00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:35,620
You got a TV in here?

831
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,012
Well,

832
00:40:01,014 --> 00:40:03,315
I'm officially off.

833
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,183
I mean, my flight doesn't
leave till tonight,

834
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:07,852
but I figured you'd be
working, so we can--

835
00:40:07,854 --> 00:40:10,155
we can just
say good-bye now.

836
00:40:12,826 --> 00:40:14,859
You were right.

837
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,297
- About what?
- I haven't always

838
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:20,598
been appreciative
of you.

839
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,201
You were always
there for me every day,

840
00:40:23,203 --> 00:40:24,769
and night.

841
00:40:24,771 --> 00:40:27,672
So if I haven't said
thank you enough,

842
00:40:27,674 --> 00:40:29,107
thank you.

843
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:30,709
[Laughs]

844
00:40:30,711 --> 00:40:33,078
But you were
wrong, too.

845
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,813
Mm-hmm?

846
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:37,882
When you said all you saw
in me was dad;

847
00:40:37,884 --> 00:40:41,052
there was nothing
of you in me.

848
00:40:41,054 --> 00:40:42,787
Well, I can't
really explain it,

849
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:45,056
but over the past two years,
I have been through a lot.

850
00:40:45,058 --> 00:40:49,227
And I have learned that I am a lot
tougher than I thought.

851
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,763
That...

852
00:40:51,765 --> 00:40:54,499
I get from you.

853
00:40:56,136 --> 00:40:58,536
don't cry.

854
00:40:58,538 --> 00:41:00,705
So I took another look
at those cogeneration numbers.

855
00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:02,540
You want to...

856
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:03,775
Oh.

857
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:04,590
Hi again.

858
00:41:04,614 --> 00:41:05,711
Hi.

859
00:41:05,712 --> 00:41:07,445
How's that new smart wearable
working out for you?

860
00:41:07,447 --> 00:41:08,813
Oh, it's, um,

861
00:41:08,815 --> 00:41:10,915
it's a real life saver.

862
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:13,618
Yeah.

863
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,388
Ray, I can't come
into work today.

864
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,490
I am...
[Coughs]

865
00:41:18,492 --> 00:41:22,127
Calling in sick.

866
00:41:22,129 --> 00:41:24,629
"Feel better."

867
00:41:24,631 --> 00:41:26,898
Thank you.

868
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,833
Thank you.
See you later.

869
00:41:28,835 --> 00:41:30,969
[Indistinct chatter]

870
00:41:35,842 --> 00:41:38,343
That's actually
pretty genius.

871
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:41,878
Man: Hello, Sara.

872
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,961
What are you
doing here?

873
00:41:56,505 --> 00:41:58,672
[Gasping]
