John Wilkes Booth for a moment

84
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:26,348
if I could,
Abraham Lincoln's killer.

85
00:06:26,414 --> 00:06:30,814
12 days, that's how long
it took to find him.

86
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,281
In his journal during
this period, he wrote

87
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:37,114
that the shadow was his friend,
the night his domain.

88
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:40,547
<i>He acknowledged that whatever
neuroses drove the criminal</i>

89
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:42,880
<i>to commit the original crime
is compounded,</i>

90
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:46,780
<i>magnified by flight,</i>

91
00:06:46,847 --> 00:06:49,981
<i>by the sounds of dogs
at his heels.</i>

92
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:51,947
Fear becomes paranoia,

93
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:55,047
<i>paranoia ultimately psychosis.</i>

94
00:06:56,747 --> 00:07:00,247
I bring this up,
because, in 140 years,

95
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:04,348
the fundamental mind of the
escaped man has not changed.

96
00:07:04,414 --> 00:07:06,014
The escaped man is still human.

97
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:09,214
He is still afraid,

98
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:12,680
and he will stop at nothing
in his attempt at flight.

99
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:15,647
<i>Fortunately for us,</i>

100

<i>while our quarry has shadow
and night as his ally,</i>

101
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:27,814
we have something far greater:
television.

102
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,714
I would encourage everyone
who is watching,

103
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,647
everyone in this country

104
00:07:32,714 --> 00:07:34,580
to take a good look
at these faces.

105
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:36,814
These men right here

106
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,513
are now the eight-most-wanted
men in America.

107
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:47,247
I thought I thought this out.

108
00:07:48,947 --> 00:07:50,314
You saw all those guys
back there?

109
00:07:50,381 --> 00:07:51,613
The key is they're back there,

110
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,114
and we're up here.

111
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,214
Yeah, and how long
is that going to last?

112
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:57,348
Yeah, especially since
we don't have a pot to piss in

113
00:07:57,414 --> 00:07:58,747
thanks to Abruzzi's
magically disappearing jet.

114
00:07:58,814 --> 00:08:00,847
Hey, you were never going
to be on that plane, brother.

115
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,081
And don't think
I don't know

116
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:03,147
where you were going
either, Scofield.

117
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:04,181
Where am I going?

118
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:05,947
Oh, I don't know.

119
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:08,147
Utah?

120
00:08:08,214 --> 00:08:10,680
When were you planning
on telling us about
the money, man?

121
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:12,381
What money?

122
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:15,047
$5 million that
Westmoreland planted

123
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:16,747
in the desert in Utah.

124
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:19,680
You don't know
what you're talking about.

125
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:22,114
<i>You wish I didn't know.</i>

126
00:08:22,181 --> 00:08:23,914
Wait, wait.
What money?

127
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:28,214
Warden?

128
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:31,448
It's a little early
for the FBI to be showing up,

129
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:32,513
don't you think?

130
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,680
Look, I get it.

131
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,181
It's still your investigation,

132
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:36,747
but once those criminals
cross state lines,

133
00:08:36,814 --> 00:08:38,214
it'll become a federal matter.

134
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:40,147
Yeah, well, that is not going
to happen.

135
00:08:40,214 --> 00:08:41,348
I hope you're right.

136
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:43,047
That's why I was going
to suggest that we cut

137
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:45,613
through any interagency
politics from the outset.

138
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,613
Full transparency.

139
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,281
Absolutely.

140
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:49,547
Good.

141
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,814
Then maybe you can tell
me about Dr. Tancredi.

142
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,414
There's nothing to tell.

143
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,414
From what I'm hearing,
she may have abetted
the escapees;

144
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,448
opened the door that
allowed them to get out.

145
00:09:01,513 --> 00:09:04,147
Like I said,
there's nothing to tell.

146
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:05,414
You're not being very
transparent, Warden.

147
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,814
Look, I don't
discuss my staff.

148
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,981
Maybe you should,

149
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:11,780
because she may
be the key to this thing.

150
00:09:11,847 --> 00:09:15,647
We need to speak
with her.

151
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:18,014
Right now, Mr. Mahone,

152
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:20,480
she's not going to be
speaking with anyone.

153
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:29,448
How are we doing?

154
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:30,847
Well, the IVs
are hydrating her.

155
00:09:30,914 --> 00:09:33,847
We got her on a
naloxone infusion,

156
00:09:33,914 --> 00:09:36,381
half milligram per hour.

157
00:09:36,448 --> 00:09:37,613
What do you think
the chances are?

158
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,480
Well, we've done
everything on our end.

159
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:40,914
It's really
up to her.

160
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:45,547
Either she fights
and lives, or she
quits and dies.

164
00:10:43,747 --> 00:10:44,513
Do whatever thing

165
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,214
you got to do, man.

166
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:51,714
Oh, and...

167
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,613
boy... you call the cops,

168
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,947
I will put this thing
right here...

169
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:02,480
...in your eye.

170
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:08,613
Thank you.

171
00:11:25,513 --> 00:11:26,314
MAHONE:
Structural engineer, huh?

172
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:28,714
IVES:
Not the kind

173
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,613
you'd expect to get
that much ink.

174
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,147
Not the kind at all.

175
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:35,014
How long do you think it'd take
to get something like that?

176
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:39,014
Hundred hours... 200.

177
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:40,247
Tattoo artist
who gave it to him

178
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:42,181
must have spent
a lot of time on him then.

179
00:11:43,348 --> 00:11:45,580
I'll find out who it was.

180
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:49,714
Mr. Bellick.

181
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,081
Don't talk to me.

182
00:11:51,147 --> 00:11:53,247
Fine, but it's going to make
collaboration kind of hard.

183
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:55,281
Collaboration?

184
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,747
I got men out here
in harm's way,

185
00:11:56,814 --> 00:11:58,513
and you're giving
press conferences.

186
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,480
The press is a tool.

187
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:02,780
It'll bring those men back
quicker than bloodhounds will.

188
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,014
We don't need you.

189
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:05,414
We're hot on
these guys' trail,

190
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,414
and it's just a matter of
time till we nail them.

191
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,880
The problem I find
with being on a trail

192
00:12:09,947 --> 00:12:13,214
is that by definition you'll
always be behind your prey.

193
00:12:15,414 --> 00:12:17,448
We'll see about that.

194
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:24,647
<i>( patting )</i>

195
00:12:24,714 --> 00:12:26,281
STEADMAN:
I'm not armed.

196
00:12:26,348 --> 00:12:27,580
VERONICA:
You'll have to excuse me

197
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,214
if I'm a little short on trust
at the moment.

198
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,947
I assure you,
young woman,

199
00:12:31,014 --> 00:12:33,480
I'm the furthest
thing from a threat.

200
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:36,214
I think the Percocet
pretty much ensures that.

201
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:39,714
Good, then you won't mind
if I capture this moment

202
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,981
for posterity.

203
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:43,181
Won't do you any good.

204
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:44,914
You don't care that someone's
going to be executed

205
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:46,314
for your murder
while you're just sitting here.

206
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:47,480
I'm not the one

207
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:50,147
choose Lincoln Burrows
as the fall guy.

208
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:52,814
Who did?
Your sister, the president?

209
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,047
You don't understand.

210
00:12:54,114 --> 00:12:55,580
I'm a prisoner to all of this.

211
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:56,580
Oh, come on.

212
00:12:56,647 --> 00:12:57,880
You could have come forward.

213
00:12:57,947 --> 00:12:59,547
You could have stopped
this thing before it even

214
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,014
got started.

215
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,114
No, I really am a prisoner.

216
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:04,947
And now, you are, too.

217
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:06,348
The moment

218
00:13:06,414 --> 00:13:09,680
you let that door shut
behind you.

219
00:13:16,314 --> 00:13:18,714
Didn't it strike you as curious

220
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,613
that there wasn't any security

221
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,981
out there?

222
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,381
The doors only open
from the outside.

223
00:13:24,448 --> 00:13:26,814
The glass is two inches thick,
bulletproof.

224
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,914
There's no getting out of here,
young woman.

225
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,247
LINCOLN:
We got to dump them now.

226
00:13:39,314 --> 00:13:40,747
Can't.

227
00:13:40,814 --> 00:13:42,081
They know about Utah.

228
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:43,780
All the more reason
to dump them.

229
00:13:43,847 --> 00:13:45,114
If they get caught,

230
00:13:45,181 --> 00:13:46,981
they feds will know
exactly where we're going.

231
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:48,613
We'll tell them.

232
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,147
We just got to make
sure they stay afloat

233
00:13:50,214 --> 00:13:56,281
until we're off in Utah,
doing what we got to do.

234
00:13:56,348 --> 00:13:59,448
You really think
the money's going to be there?

235
00:13:59,513 --> 00:14:01,580
Charles might have had
a flexible relationship

236
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:04,414
with the truth,
but at the end...

237
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,947
at the end, there'd
be no reason for him
to lie about it.

238
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:10,680
I figure once we bag it,
we cross over into Mexico,

239
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:12,747
take a whole bunch of bumpy
second-class bus rides

240
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:15,147
till we hit Panama.

241
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:17,014
LINCOLN:
You really got a fix on this
dive shop thing, huh?

242
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:18,947
<i>( both chuckling )
Yeah.</i>

243
00:14:19,014 --> 00:14:22,047
Right now, I wouldn't
mind swinging in a hammock

244
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:23,747
for the next
ten or 20 years.

245
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:25,780
We got half the country
after us.

246
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:28,081
We ain't making it
to Panama or Utah.

247
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:29,348
Not without help.

248
00:14:31,381 --> 00:14:33,014
Veronica can't help us.

249
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,414
How can you say that?

250
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,147
We don't have money, clothes...

251
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:37,914
I already got all that.

252
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:39,314
I thought the plan
was Abruzzi's jet.

253
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:41,814
Abruzzi's jet
was Plan A.

254
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:44,181
Then we got...

255
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:45,547
Everything we need.

256
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:46,580
Where?

257
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:50,247
Storage.

258
00:14:59,847 --> 00:15:01,114
<i>MAHONE:

260
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:03,947
every element.

261
00:15:04,014 --> 00:15:06,014
I mean, look at it; it's
the freakin' Sistine Chapel.

262
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:08,081
I knew the guy was an engineer
or whatever,

263
00:15:08,147 --> 00:15:11,480
but man, his skill as an
artist was unbelievable.

264
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:12,513
What else?

265
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,680
What can you tell me
about him as a person?

266
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,981
Uh, he was cool,
you know.

267
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:18,847
But talk about
a detail nazi.

268
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:20,513
Everything had
to be perfect,

269
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,214
exactly as he drew it.

270
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:25,314
I always sort of had the feeling
that the whole thing

271
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:27,348
was some sort of inside joke

272
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:29,014
that only he
was in on.

273
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,613
We have your number,
right?

274
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,814
Yeah.

275
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,647
I may be calling you.

279
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:49,547
English Boulevard.

ABRUZZI:
Where we going?

285
00:16:06,181 --> 00:16:07,281
Somewhere

00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:09,114
and start being civilians.

287

you cut out all the

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,580
What are you doing
out here?

304
00:16:48,647 --> 00:16:50,880

00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:38,874
I'll pull the trigger.

326
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,340
Two!

327
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:47,674
Good boy.

328
00:17:47,741 --> 00:17:49,073
Get the gun.

329
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,207
Pick it up!

330
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,307
Don't you hurt her, don't you...

331
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:55,374
Hey!

Okay?

00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:03,874
Run to Daddy.

336
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,207
I ain't going to say
anything, to anybody, man.

337
00:18:08,274 --> 00:18:10,174
MICHAEL:???

338
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,374

<i>FOLEY:
You're being considered</i>

an accessory to this;

342
00:18:30,174 --> 00:18:33,874
I know very little right now.

343
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,774
You opened the door
to the infirmary

344
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:37,040
that allowed Scofield
to escape,

345
00:18:37,107 --> 00:18:38,040
didn't you?

346
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:39,474
No.

347
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,274
Did you have a sexual
relationship with Scofield?

348
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,340
No.

349
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:45,474
But you had feelings
for him.

350
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,374
Seven other men got out,
you know.

351
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:51,441

Oh, I am sorry, sir.

00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:09,174
It's Saturday;
we're not open.

355
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,474
Well, that's sort of
the point.

356
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,140
Sorry, sir?

357
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:16,174
See, I'm going to need
some work done,

358
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,774
and I'm going to need
it done privately.

<i>I'm sorry, you said you
needed the work done?</i>

360

This is a medical clinic,
isn't it?

361
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,007
Well, of course it is, sir,
but for animals.

362
00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:33,940
Oh, man, what
happened to you?

363
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,274
You need medical
attention.

364
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,841
Sir, listen...
Hold up.

365
00:19:36,908 --> 00:19:38,707

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,774
Fine.

That's it. I want Eye-Tie out
of the car right now, man.

374
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:03,007
That was a little girl!

00:20:03,073 --> 00:20:04,441
Don't you have a heart?

376
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:05,808
God!

377
00:20:05,874 --> 00:20:07,007
I have a
daughter.

378
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,174
I have a
little girl!

379
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,507
I got one, too.

380
00:20:10,574 --> 00:20:13,240
But if I hadn't done
what I had to do,

381
00:20:13,307 --> 00:20:17,007
we wouldn't be on
our way to see 'em
right now, would we?

382
00:20:17,073 --> 00:20:18,674
Turn right up there.

C-NOTE:
Whoa, whoa.

384
00:20:20,073 --> 00:20:21,741
Hold on. Where we going?

385
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:23,040
MICHAEL:
Oswego.

386
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:24,240
That's west, man.

387
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,808
We need to go east.

388
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:27,207
My family's back
in Chicago.

389
00:20:27,274 --> 00:20:29,407
And you think
the cops don't know about it?

390
00:20:29,474 --> 00:20:31,441
You think
they're not just

391
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:35,441
sitting there, waiting for you
to come running back home?

392
00:20:35,507 --> 00:20:37,541
What's the matter
with you?

393
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:39,107
SUCRE:
Well, what about
New York?

394
00:20:39,174 --> 00:20:40,707
What about it?

395
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:41,908
My girl's
pregnant, bro.

396
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:44,908
Understand your love
is your weakness right now,

397
00:20:44,973 --> 00:20:46,441
and they know about it.

398
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:49,007
MICHAEL:
Doesn't mean it
has to stop you.

399
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:51,607
You just got
to be smart about it.

400
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:54,707
Get to Oswego.

401
00:20:54,774 --> 00:20:56,841
Oswego was not
on the way, Snowflake.

402
00:20:56,908 --> 00:20:59,841
MICHAEL:
It's not
where Oswego is.

403
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:03,207
It's what's in Oswego.

404
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:06,841
Captain, Scofield's credit
card transaction history.

405
00:21:06,908 --> 00:21:09,274
Spent a lot of money here
in Will County

406
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,441
before he was incarcerated?

407
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:11,808
Exactly.
He was from Chicago.

408
00:21:11,874 --> 00:21:13,940
Why does a guy from Chicago
come all the way out here

409
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:15,707
and spend north of eight grand
in all these places

410
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,908
in little over a month?

411
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:18,374
Car wash, voice mail,
storage, car rental...

412
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:19,874
We got guys
looking into it.
Good.

413
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,973
Hey, Captain, what about the
Feds? Should we tell them?

414
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,607
What do you think?
Captain Bellick?
Captain Bellick?

415
00:21:23,674 --> 00:21:24,940
We got something.

416
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:27,908
Hunter up by Tamarack just
ran into five of the cons.

417
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:36,274
<i>MAHONE:
So this is
where Scofield lived?</i>

418
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,507
IVES:
Yeah, up until about two months
ago when he was incarcerated.

419
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:46,940
Mother's dead,
father's a deadbeat.

420
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:52,274
You got nothing in the
whole world but your brother.

421
00:21:58,374 --> 00:22:01,340
So you plan.

422
00:22:10,574 --> 00:22:12,908
And you scheme for months...

423
00:22:15,973 --> 00:22:17,908
...till you get it right.

424
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:22,507
<i>Every single element.</i>

425
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,973
And then you destroy
all the evidence.

426
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:46,040
I want divers down in the river.

427
00:22:49,274 --> 00:22:51,607
You won't get
cell coverage.

428
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:54,274
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

429
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,973
<i>( laughing ):
Digital carriers don't have
cell towers way out here</i>

430
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,274

431
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,774
How about shutting up, Terrence?

432
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:02,240
Just trying to save
you some effort.

433
00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:03,574
They're like a
web, these people.

434
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:05,274
The harder you struggle,
the worse it gets.

435
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,073
Sounds to me like a coward
trying to justify himself.

436
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,607
If I stay out of the way
and stay quiet, I stay alive.

437
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:14,007
That's what they
said; that's what
they told me.

438
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:15,908
And you're willing
to live like this,

439
00:23:15,973 --> 00:23:17,073
in a hermetically-sealed box

440
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,908
while everything out there
goes to hell?

441
00:23:18,973 --> 00:23:21,040
Self-preservation is
a strong motivator.

442
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:23,541
So is the truth.

443

How you doing, buddy?

448

I'm pretty freaked out,
that's how I'm doing.

449
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,808
They took your car, didn't they?

450
00:23:49,874 --> 00:23:51,307
1978 Grand
Cherokee.

451
00:23:51,374 --> 00:23:52,641
Yeah.
Which way did they go?

452
00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:55,140
Up that way north
toward Oswego.

453
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:58,007
Oswego. Pardon me.

454
00:23:58,073 --> 00:23:59,808
Scofield's paperwork--
get it, Jimmy.

455
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:01,240
The credit card stuff.

456
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,374
Right here, Captain.

457
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:09,741
Of course.

458
00:24:09,808 --> 00:24:13,441
Where is he going to put all
the crap you need to disappear?

459
00:24:13,507 --> 00:24:16,073
We're going
to Oswego, boys.

460
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,427
You have a visitor.

461
00:24:26,493 --> 00:24:28,894
Thank you.

462
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,261
Thanks.

463
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:43,027
You look disappointed.

464
00:24:43,094 --> 00:24:45,594
No. I thought you were going
to be my father.

465
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,627
You heard from him?

466
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,328
His office.

467
00:24:50,393 --> 00:24:53,360
Well, brought you a change

468
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:55,360
of clothes.

469
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,161
Figured, you know...

470
00:24:57,228 --> 00:24:58,627
Thanks.

471
00:24:58,694 --> 00:25:01,061
And your purse.

472
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:02,560
You left it in the infirmary.

473
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,927
I'm in a lot of trouble,
I think.

474
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,061
I, um...

475
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:19,127
I need

476
00:25:19,194 --> 00:25:21,994
to apologize to you.

477
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:37,727
They threatened my job
if I didn't talk, and...

478
00:25:37,794 --> 00:25:40,061
No, no, no, no. No.

479
00:25:40,127 --> 00:25:42,527
One thing you learn
when you're walking the steps

480
00:25:42,594 --> 00:25:44,427
is that you never
outsource a blame

481
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:45,994
that belongs
in your own backyard.

482
00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:51,161
Well,

483
00:25:51,228 --> 00:25:53,460
you're not the first
correctional worker

484
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:55,427
that fell for a con,

485

Civilians.

Hey.

654
00:36:06,037 --> 00:36:08,337
I'm sorry, uh.
Do you know what time it is?

655
00:36:08,404 --> 00:36:10,104
No, sorry.

They'll kill me

658
00:36:28,904 --> 00:36:29,837
You're wrong about that.

659
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:31,271
As soon as you show your face,

660
00:36:31,337 --> 00:36:33,437
this whole thing
is gonna be over.

661
00:36:33,504 --> 00:36:35,004
You can have
your life back, Terrence.

Promise?

You got to stop.

671
00:36:49,638 --> 00:36:51,237
I need you to turn yourself in.

What?

673
00:36:52,571 --> 00:36:54,137
I found Steadman.
I'm with him now, Linc.

674
00:36:54,204 --> 00:36:55,870
He's alive.

675
00:36:55,937 --> 00:36:57,371
You're going to be exonerated.

What are you talking about,
you found Steadman?

Terrence, come on, let's go.

The police are here.

683
00:37:07,104 --> 00:37:08,404
Look, I need you to stay

00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:09,604
where you are.

685
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,237
Ma'am.
I don't want to lose you.

686
00:37:11,304 --> 00:37:13,004
Ma'am, put the phone down.

687
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,137
What?

688
00:37:14,204 --> 00:37:15,137
Mr. Steadman,

689
00:37:15,204 --> 00:37:17,204
take a few steps back.

I thought you knew that
all calls to the local station

697
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,171
are routed through us.

698
00:38:11,237 --> 00:38:12,604
This is federal land, remember?

699
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,604
Mm.

700
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,037
And, uh, as for

701
00:38:15,104 --> 00:38:16,137
your little toy here,

702
00:38:16,204 --> 00:38:17,404
it's contraband.

703
00:38:17,471 --> 00:38:19,471
You gonna tell us
how you got it in there?

704
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:22,237
I brought it
when I got here.

705
00:38:22,304 --> 00:38:24,870
Whatever for?

706
00:38:24,937 --> 00:38:27,137
To protect myself.
Mm.

707
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:31,004

I wouldn't be so sure
about that, Mr. Ives.

716
00:39:53,104 --> 00:39:54,837
I don't know how you
can be so confident.

717

It's not like these guys left
a map where they're going.

Actually, that's
exactly what they did.

before we know
everything

00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:17,604
that is in
Scofield's head--

<i>where he plans to run to,
how he plans to get there.</i>

we'll be waiting for him.
