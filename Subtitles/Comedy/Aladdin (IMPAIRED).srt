00:09:57,947 --> 00:10:01,110
Here. Go on. Take it.

165
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,083
[giggling]

166
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:09,118
[groans]

167
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:19,132
Ah, don't. Huh?

168
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:27,606
On his way to the palace, I suppose.

169
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:30,805
Another suitor for the princess.

170
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,576
- [giggling]
- [woman screams]

171
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:36,379
- [whinnying]
- Out of my way, you filthy brats.

172
00:10:36,452 --> 00:10:37,919
Hey!

173
00:10:37,987 --> 00:10:40,683
If I were as rich as you,
I could afford some manners.

174
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:43,725
Oh. I'll teach you some manners.

175
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:45,385
[men laugh]

176
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:48,328
[grimacing]

177
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,228
Look at that, Abu.

178
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:53,564
It's not every day you see
a horse with two rear ends.

179
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:55,126
[crowd] Ooh!

180
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:58,196
You are a worthless street rat.

181
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:01,573
You were born a street rat,
you'll die a street rat,

182
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:04,772
and only your fleas will mourn you.

183
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,851
I'm not worthless.

184
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,149
And I don't have fleas.

185
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,884
[sighs] Come on, Abu.
Let's go home.

186
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,062
"Riffraff, street rat

187
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:30,469
"I don't buy that

[sighs]

195
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:02,201
Some day, Abu,
things are gonna change.

196
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:04,229
We'll be rich, live in a palace,

197
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:08,572
and never have any problems at all.

198
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,544
[roosters crowing]

199
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:14,009
I've never been so insulted.

200
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,917
Oh, Prince Achmed.
You're not leaving so soon, are you?

201
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,080
Good luck marrying her off.

202
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,750
Oh! Jasmine.

203
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:26,118
[Sultan] Jasmine!

204
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:28,095
Jasmine!

205
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,189
- Jasmine!
- [snarling]

206
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:32,393
Confound it, Rajah.

207
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:38,866
So, this is why Prince Achmed
stormed out.

208
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:40,431
Oh, Father.

209
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,342
Rajah wasjust playing with him.
Weren't you, Rajah?

210
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:45,642
You werejust playing
with that overdressed,

211
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:48,478
self-absorbed Prince Achmed,
weren't you?

212
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:49,984
[both laughing]

213
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,351
[clears throat]

214
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:56,915
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes to call.

215
00:12:56,992 --> 00:13:00,860
The law says
you must be married to a prince...

216
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:02,897
by your next birthday.

217
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:04,422
The law is wrong.

218
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,764
You've only got three more days.

219
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:10,499
Father, I hate being forced into this.

220
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:13,872
If I do marry,
I want it to be for love.

221
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:16,104
Jasmine...

222
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:19,375
it's not only this law.

223
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:26,046
I'm not going to be around forever,
and, well, I...

224
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:29,784
I just want to make sure
you're taken care of.

225
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:31,258
Provided for.

226
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:34,057
Please try to understand.

227
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:38,361
I've never done a thing on my own.
I've never had any real friends.

228
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:39,526
[grumbles]

229
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:41,194
Except you, Rajah.

230
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:45,771
I've never even been
outside the palace walls.

231
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:48,309
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.

232
00:13:48,377 --> 00:13:51,312
Then maybe I don't want
to be a princess anymore.

233
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,247
Oooh! I... I...

234
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:57,410
Allah forbid you should
have any daughters.

235
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:58,953
Hmm?

236
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:13,063
I don't know where she gets it from.

237
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:17,128
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.

238
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:19,731
Oh! Ah, Jafar.

239
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:23,369
My most trusted advisor.

240
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,278
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.

241
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:29,112
My life is but to serve you, my lord.

242
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:30,879
It's this suitor business.

243
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,444
Jasmine refuses
to choose a husband.

244
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:36,514
- I'm at my wit's end.
- Awk! Wit's end!

245
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:38,457
[laughing] Oh!

246
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:43,096
- Have a cracker, pretty Polly.
- [Jafar laughs]

247
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:46,464
Your Majesty certainly
has a way with dumb animals.

248
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:47,695
[grumbles]

249
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,264
Now, then,
perhaps I can divine a solution

250
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:54,468
to this thorny problem.

251
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:56,135
If anyone can help, it's you.

252
00:14:56,211 --> 00:15:01,342
But it would require the use
of the mystic blue diamond.

253
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:04,318
Oh. Uh, my ring?

254
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:06,752
But it's been in the family for years.

255
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:10,087
It is necessary to find
the princess a suitor.

256
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,956
Don't worry.

257
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:15,690
Everything will be fine.

258
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:18,324
Everything will be... fine.

259
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,493
The diamond.

260
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:23,094
Here, Jafar.

261
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,608
Whatever you need will be fine.

262
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,405
You are most gracious, my liege.

263
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:33,141
Now, run along and play
with your little toys, hmm?

264
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:36,742
Yes. That will be pretty good.

265
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:39,944
[spits, coughs]

266
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,115
I can't take it anymore!

267
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:48,187
If I gotta choke down on one more
of those moldy, disgusting crackers...

268
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:50,490
Bam! Whack!

269
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:51,931
Calm yourself, lago.

270
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,333
Then I'd grab him around the head.
Whack!

271
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:58,237
Soon I will be sultan,
not that addle-pated twit.

272
00:15:58,307 --> 00:16:02,676
And then I stuff the crackers
down his throat.

273
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:04,269
Ha, ha!

274
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,157
[whining]

275
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,290
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.

276
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:27,529
But I can't stay here
and have my life lived for me.

277
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:31,664
I'll miss you.

278
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:40,037
[whimpers]

279
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:41,878
Goodbye.

280
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:52,620
[vendors calling out]

281
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:54,356
Okay, Abu. Go.

282
00:16:56,165 --> 00:17:00,363
Try this. Your taste buds
will dance and sing.

283
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,529
[squeaking]

284
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,765
- Get your paws off that.
- [taunting]

285
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,898
Why, you...

286
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:09,740
Get away from here,
you cursed, filthy ape!

287
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,941
Goodbye.

288
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:16,314
- Nice going, Abu.
- [cooing]

289
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:18,615
Breakfast is served.

290
00:17:22,357 --> 00:17:24,416
Pretty lady, buy a pot.

291
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:26,825
No finer pot in brass or silver.

292
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:29,363
Sugar dates.
Sugar dates and figs.

293
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:31,626
Sugar dates and pistachios.

294
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,497
Would the lady like a necklace?

295
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:36,129
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

296
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:37,570
Fresh fish!

297
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,129
We catch 'em, you buy 'em!

298
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,869
Oh, no. I don't think so.

299
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:42,342
- Oh!
- [gulping]

300
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:45,346
- Excuse me.
- [gulps]

301
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:47,279
[belches]

302
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,519
I'm really very sorry.

303
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:54,388
Wow.

304
00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:01,627
Uh-oh.

305
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:03,756
Hello? Hello?

306
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:09,270
Oh, you must be hungry.

307
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,999
Here you go.

308
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:14,236
You'd better be able to pay for that.

309
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:15,435
Pay?

310
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,604
No one steals from my cart.

311
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,443
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have any money.

312
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,949
- Thief!
- Please...

313
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:26,044
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the Sultan.

314
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:28,316
Do you know what
the penalty is for stealing?

315
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,119
No! No, please!

316
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,184
Thank you, kind sir.
I'm so glad you found her.

317
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:35,253
I've been looking all over for you.

318
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,423
- What are you doing?
- Just play along.

319
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:39,865
You, uh, know this girl?

320
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:42,529
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.

321
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:44,196
She's a little crazy.

322
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:47,071
She said she knew the Sultan.

323
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:49,975
She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

324
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,643
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?

325
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,709
[gibberish]

326
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:01,085
Tragic, isn't it?

327
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:03,181
But no harm done.

328
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:06,091
Now, come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.

329
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:08,652
Oh, hello, Doctor.
How are you?

330
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,359
- No, no, no. Not that one.
- Come on, Sultan.

331
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:14,732
[gibbering, gasping]

332
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:16,798
Huh? What?

333
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:20,336
Come back here, you little thieves!

334
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:23,438
[explosion]

335
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:27,246
With all due respect,
Your Rottenness,

336
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:30,911
couldn't wejust wait
for a real storm?

337
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:32,977
Save your breath, lago. Faster.

338
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:36,754
Yes, O mighty Evil One.

339
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:37,883
[panting]

340
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:42,320
Part, sands of time.

341
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:46,561
Reveal to me the one
who can enter the cave.

342
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:49,968
Yes! Yes!

343
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:52,438
There he is.

344
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:54,873
My diamond in the rough.

345
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:58,538
That's him? That's the clown
we've been waitin' for?

346
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:04,883
Let's have the guards extend him
an invitation to the palace, shall we?

347
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,545
Swell.

348
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,317
[coughs]

349
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,518
[sinister laughter]

350
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:13,584
Almost there.

351
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:24,372
I want to thank you
for stopping that man.

352
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:26,100
Uh, forget it.

353
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:31,540
So, this is your first time
in the marketplace, huh?

354
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:34,475
Is it that obvious?

355
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:37,609
Well, you do kind of stand out.

356
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:44,118
I mean, uh, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

357
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:46,786
Hmm. I'm a fast learner.

358
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:48,352
Wow.

359
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,658
[chuckling] Hey.

360
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:54,792
Come on. This way.

361
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,930
Whoa. Watch your head there.

362
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,564
Be careful.

363
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:01,438
Is this where you live?

364
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,707
Yep. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.

365
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,748
That sounds fabulous.

366
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:11,081
Well, it's not much,
but it's got a great view.

367
00:21:11,887 --> 00:21:15,015
Wow. The palace looks
pretty amazing, huh?

368
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,888
Oh, it's wonderful.

369
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,087
I wonder what it would
be like to live there,

370
00:21:20,162 --> 00:21:22,653
and have servants and valets.

371
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:26,394
Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

372
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:28,936
It's better than here.

373
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:31,802
You're always scraping for food
and ducking the guards.

374
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,103
You're not free to make
your own choices.

375
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:36,770
- Sometimes you feel so...
- You'rejust...

376
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:39,109
[both]... trapped.

377
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,449
[clears throat]
So, where are you from?

378
00:21:46,621 --> 00:21:48,179
What does it matter?

379
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:50,850
I ran away
and I am not going back.

380
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:53,520
Really? How come?

381
00:21:53,595 --> 00:21:55,256
Why, you...

382
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,596
My father's forcing me
to get married.

383
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:02,466
That's... that's awful.

384
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:07,030
- [Aladdin] Abu!
- [angry squeaking]

385
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:09,304
What?

386
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:13,041
Abu says, uh...
that's not fair.

387
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:14,207
What?

388
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:16,682
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah, of course.

389
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,552
And does Abu
have anything else to say?

390
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:24,149
Well, uh, he wishes there was
something he could do to help.

391
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:26,285
Oh, boy.

392
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:27,988
Hmm.

393
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:31,590
Tell him that's very sweet.

394
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:35,292
Here you are.

395
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,806
- [both] They're after me! You?
- My father must have sent them...

396
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:40,136
- Do you trust me?
- What?

397
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:43,234
- Do you trust me?
- Yes...

398
00:22:43,311 --> 00:22:44,903
Then jump!

399
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:54,819
Wejust keep running into each other,
don't we, street rat?

400
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:57,715
Run! Go! Get out of here!

401
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,261
Get this thing off of me!

402
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:03,195
- It's the dungeon for you, boy.
- Get off of me.

403
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:04,596
Let him go.

404
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:09,160
- Looky here, men. A street mouse.
- [guards laugh]

405
00:23:09,237 --> 00:23:12,832
Unhand him,
by order of the princess.

406
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,973
Princess Jasmine.

407
00:23:16,044 --> 00:23:17,807
- The princess?
- [Abu] Princess?

408
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:20,939
What are you doing outside the palace?
And with this street rat.

409
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:24,816
That's not your concern.
Do as I command. Release him.

410
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:29,118
I would, Princess,
except my orders come from Jafar.

411
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:33,127
- You'll have to take it up with him.
- Believe me, I will.

412
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:41,267
Jafar?

413
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,133
Oh, Princess.

414
00:23:43,205 --> 00:23:45,639
Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.

415
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:47,937
How may I be of service to you?

416
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:51,342
The guardsjust took a boy
from the market, on your orders.

417
00:23:51,413 --> 00:23:55,679
Your father has charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.

418
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,275
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?

419
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,684
I can't breathe, Jafar.

420
00:23:59,754 --> 00:24:03,349
Why, kidnapping the princess,
of course.

421
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:05,757
If you could just...
Aah! That hurt!

422
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:08,523
He didn't kidnap me.
I ran away.

423
00:24:08,597 --> 00:24:11,532
Oh, dear.

424
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,900
Oh, how frightfully upsetting.
Had I but known...

425
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:17,199
What do you mean?

426
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:20,867
Sadly, the boy's sentence
has already been carried out.

427
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:22,409
What sentence?

428
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:24,468
- Death.
- [gasping]

429
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,538
- By beheading.
- No.

430
00:24:30,252 --> 00:24:33,653
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.

431
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,418
How could you?

432
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:38,288
[weeping]

433
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,158
[coughing]

434
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,189
[coughing, gasping]

435
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:48,361
So, how did it go?

436
00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:52,133
I think she took it... rather well.

437
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,569
[Jasmine crying]

438
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,681
It's all my fault, Rajah.

439
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:13,453
- I didn't even know his name.
- [Rajah murmuring]

440
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:34,314
She was the princess.

441
00:25:34,382 --> 00:25:36,748
I can't believe it.

442
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:39,150
I must have sounded
so stupid to her.

443
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:41,621
[Abu] Yoo-hoo! Aladdin!

444
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,021
Hello!

445
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:45,821
Abu. Down here.

446
00:25:45,894 --> 00:25:48,055
[squeaking]

447
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,154
Come on, help me out of these.

448
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:52,359
[scolding]

449
00:25:57,172 --> 00:26:00,903
Hey, she was in trouble.
Ah, she was worth it.

450
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,841
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

451
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:05,004
Don't worry.
I'll never see her again.

452
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,516
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there's a law.

453
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:10,676
She's gotta marry a prince.

454
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:15,122
- She deserves a prince.
- Ta-da!

455
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,249
I'm a fool.

456
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:21,261
[man] You're only a fool
if you give up, boy.

457
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,591
Who are you?

458
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:26,100
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.

459
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,102
But together,
perhaps we can be more.

460
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,468
I'm listening.

461
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:35,498
There is a cave, boy,
a Cave of Wonders,

462
00:26:35,577 --> 00:26:39,741
filled with treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

463
00:26:39,814 --> 00:26:41,543
Ooh!

464
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:45,609
Treasure enough to impress even
your princess, I'd wager.

465
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,247
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I'm dyin' in here.

466
00:26:48,323 --> 00:26:50,951
- [squawking]
- But the law says only a prince can...

467
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,859
You've heard of the golden rule,
haven't you?

468
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:56,362
Whoever has the gold
makes the rules.

469
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:57,830
[wheezing laugh]

470
00:26:57,932 --> 00:27:01,197
Why would you share all of this
wonderful treasure with me?

471
00:27:01,236 --> 00:27:05,832
I need a young pair of legs and
a strong back to go in after it.

472
00:27:05,907 --> 00:27:07,568
Uh, one problem.

473
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:09,701
It's out there.
We're in here.

474
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:14,545
Uh-uh. Things aren't always
what they seem.

475
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:17,414
So...

476
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:19,544
do we have a deal?

477
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:21,987
Oh, I don't know.

478
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,922
[thunder crashing]

479
00:27:32,934 --> 00:27:36,802
Who disturbs my slumber?

480
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,804
Uh, it is I, Aladdin.

481
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,879
Proceed.

482
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:49,974
Touch nothing but the lamp.

483
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:53,282
Remember, boy,
first fetch me the lamp,

484
00:27:53,355 --> 00:27:57,314
and then you shall
have your reward.

485
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:59,155
Come on, Abu.

486
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:11,997
[squeaking]

487
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:15,836
- Would you look at that!
- [whimpering]

488
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:23,082
Just a handful of this stuff

Looks like such a beat-up,
worthless piece ofjunk.

Hey, I think there's
something written here,

but it's hard to make out.

Hi. Where you from?
What's your name?

579
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:51,298
Uh... Uh, Aladdin.

580

Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.

581
00:35:54,368 --> 00:35:56,427
Can we call you "Al"?
Or maybejust "Din."

582
00:35:56,504 --> 00:36:00,235
How about "Laddie"?
Sounds like, "Here, boy. C'mon, Laddie."

583
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:03,970
I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.

584

Do you smoke? Mind if I do?

Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you
in a few millennia.

than my last master.

That or I'm gettin' bigger.
Look from the side. Do I look different?

590
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,491
Wait a minute.
I'm your master?

591
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:29,559
That's right. He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?

592
00:36:29,637 --> 00:36:31,935

"All you gotta do is rub like so

653
00:39:01,622 --> 00:39:05,490
"Mr. Aladdin, sir
Have a wish ortwo orthree

654
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:08,050

Never had a friend

Ah ha ha!

663
00:39:23,077 --> 00:39:25,568
- Wah ha ha!
- [greedy laugh]

664
00:39:25,646 --> 00:39:28,479
"You ain't never had a friend like me"

665
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:30,418
- [buzzing]
- [weak applause]

666
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:33,418
[chattering] Huh?

667
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:35,614
- [groans]
- So, what'll it be, Master?

668
00:39:35,689 --> 00:39:40,058
You're gonna grant me
any three wishes I want, right?

669
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,560
Ah, almost.

670
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,598
There are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quos.

671
00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:45,654
Like?

672
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:49,191
Ah, rule number one:
I can't kill anybody.

673
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,567
So don't ask.

674
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,003
Rule number two.

675
00:39:52,073 --> 00:39:56,100
I can't make anybody
fall in love with anybody else.

676
00:39:56,177 --> 00:39:58,168
You little punim there.

677
00:39:58,245 --> 00:40:02,579
Rule number three. I can't bring
people back from the dead.

678
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,881
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.

679
00:40:05,953 --> 00:40:08,285
Other than that, you got it.

680
00:40:08,355 --> 00:40:10,152
- Hmm.
- Oh!

681
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:15,356
Provisos?
You mean limitations?

682
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:18,330
On wishes?
Some all-powerful genie.

683
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:21,163
Can't even bring people
back from the dead.

684
00:40:21,235 --> 00:40:24,932
I don't know, Abu. He probably
can't even get us out of this cave.

685
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:27,200
Looks like we're gonna have to
find a way out.

686
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:29,242
Excuse me?

687
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:32,302
Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

688
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:35,177
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

689
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:37,274
And you're walking out on me?

690
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,548
I don't think so,
not right now.

691
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:42,714
You're gettin' your wishes,
so sit down!

692
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,384
- [Abu screeches]
- In case of emergency,

693
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:47,825
the exits are here, here,
here, here, anywhere.

694
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:50,523
Keep your hands and arms
inside the carpet.

695
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:52,566
We're...

696
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:55,193
outta here!

697
00:40:56,103 --> 00:40:56,203
[Sultan] Jafar, this is an outrage.

698
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:59,764
[Sultan] Jafar, this is an outrage.

699
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,866
If it weren't for all your years
of loyal service...

700
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:07,006
From now on, you are to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me,

701
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:09,641
before they are beheaded.

702
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,652
I assure you, Your Highness,
it won't happen again.

703
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,017
Jasmine...

704
00:41:14,088 --> 00:41:19,185
Jafar. Let's put this whole
messy business behind us.

705
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,352
Please.

706
00:41:20,427 --> 00:41:24,523
My most abject and humblest apologies
to you as well, Princess.

707
00:41:24,598 --> 00:41:27,863
At least some good will come
of my being forced to marry.

708
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:32,065
When I am queen, I will have
the power to get rid of you.

709
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:33,800
[chuckles nervously]

710
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:36,468
That's nice.
All settled, then.

711
00:41:36,544 --> 00:41:39,741
Now, Jasmine, getting back to
this suitor business... Jasmine?

712
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:42,004
Jasmine!

713
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,209
[growls]

714
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:47,846
If only I had gotten that lamp.

715
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:51,187
"I will have the power
to get rid of you."

716
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,250
[growling] To think
we gotta keep kissing up

717
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:58,287
to that chump
and his chump daughter

718
00:41:58,365 --> 00:42:01,061
- for the rest of our lives...
- No, lago.

719
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:04,730
Only until she finds
a chump husband.

720
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:06,670
Then she'll have us banished.

721
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,368
Or beheaded.

722
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,377
[both] Eww!

723
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,379
Oh. Wait a minute.

724
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:17,440
Jafar. What if you were
the chump husband?

725
00:42:17,518 --> 00:42:18,644
What?

726
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,280
Okay, you marry
the princess, all right?

727
00:42:22,356 --> 00:42:26,122
And, uh, then you
become the sultan.

728
00:42:26,193 --> 00:42:27,558
Oh.

729
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,153
Marry the shrew.

730
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:32,665
I become the sultan.

731
00:42:32,733 --> 00:42:35,759
- The idea has merit.
- Yes, merit. Yes.

732
00:42:35,836 --> 00:42:42,765
And then we drop papa-in-law
and the little woman off a cliff.

733
00:42:42,843 --> 00:42:44,367
Yaaah!

734
00:42:44,445 --> 00:42:46,504
Kersplat!

735
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,104
[wicked laughter]

736
00:42:48,182 --> 00:42:51,345
I love the way
your foul little mind works.

737
00:42:51,418 --> 00:42:54,216
[both laugh sinisterly]

738
00:43:00,094 --> 00:43:04,224
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.

739
00:43:04,298 --> 00:43:08,098
Don't stand until the rug
has come to a complete stop.

740
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,193
Thank you.
Goodbye now. Good-ye.

741
00:43:10,271 --> 00:43:11,363
Thank you.

742
00:43:11,438 --> 00:43:15,534
Well, how about that,
Mr. Doubting Mustafa?

743
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:15,676
Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.

744
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:20,477
Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.

745
00:43:20,547 --> 00:43:22,708
Dost mine ears deceive me?

746
00:43:22,783 --> 00:43:25,217
Three? You are down by one, boy.

747
00:43:25,286 --> 00:43:29,052
Ah, no. I never actually wished
to get out of the cave.

748
00:43:29,123 --> 00:43:30,886
You did that on your own.

749
00:43:33,927 --> 00:43:35,827
Well, I feel sheepish.

750
00:43:35,896 --> 00:43:39,161
All right, you baaad boy,
but no more freebies.

751
00:43:39,233 --> 00:43:42,532
Fair deal.
So, three wishes.

752
00:43:42,603 --> 00:43:44,594
I want them to be good.

753
00:43:44,672 --> 00:43:46,401
What would you wish for?

754
00:43:46,473 --> 00:43:48,464
Me?

755
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,737
No one's ever asked me that before.

756
00:43:50,811 --> 00:43:53,746
Well, in my case...
Ah, forget it.

757
00:43:53,814 --> 00:43:55,805
- What?
- No, I can't. I...

758
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,181
Come on. Tell me.

759
00:43:58,285 --> 00:43:59,377
Freedom.

760
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,354
You're a prisoner?

761
00:44:01,422 --> 00:44:03,890
It's all part and parcel
of the whole genie gig.

762
00:44:03,957 --> 00:44:07,688
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

763
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:09,126
Itty bitty living space.

764
00:44:09,196 --> 00:44:11,391
Genie, that's terrible.

765
00:44:11,465 --> 00:44:13,990
But, oh, to be free.

766
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,400
Not have to go,
"Poof. What do you need?

767
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:19,132
Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"

768
00:44:19,206 --> 00:44:21,106
To be my own master.

769
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:23,939
Such a thing would be
greater than all the magic

770
00:44:24,011 --> 00:44:26,707
and all the treasures
in all the world.

771
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,715
But what am I talking about?
Let's get real here.

772
00:44:29,783 --> 00:44:31,182
It's not gonna happen.

773
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,446
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.

774
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,885
Why not?

775
00:44:34,955 --> 00:44:38,789
The only way I get outta this
is if my master wishes me out.

776
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:41,259
So you can guess how often
that's happened.

777
00:44:41,328 --> 00:44:43,057
I'll do it. I'll set you free.

778
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:47,464
- Uh-huh, yeah, right.
- No, really, I promise.

779
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:49,365
After I make my first two wishes,

780
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:52,701
I'll use my third wish
to set you free.

781
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,900
Well, here's hopin'.
All right.

782
00:44:54,975 --> 00:44:57,307
Let's make some magic.

783
00:44:57,378 --> 00:45:00,108
So how 'bout it?
What is it you want most?

784
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,014
Well, there's this girl.

785
00:45:04,084 --> 00:45:05,415
Wrong.

786
00:45:05,486 --> 00:45:08,046
I can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?

787
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,589
Oh, but, Genie,

788
00:45:09,656 --> 00:45:12,591
she's smart and fun and...

789
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:14,627
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.

790
00:45:14,695 --> 00:45:18,256
She's got these eyes thatjust...
and this hair. Wow.

791
00:45:18,332 --> 00:45:20,664
And her smile... [sighs]

792
00:45:20,734 --> 00:45:21,996
Ami.

793
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:24,230
C'est I'amour.

794
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,363
But she's the princess.

795
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,431
To even have a chance,
I'd have to be...

796
00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:31,444
Hey, can you make me a prince?

797
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:33,036
Let's see here.

798
00:45:33,113 --> 00:45:35,877
Chicken a la king? Nope.

799
00:45:35,949 --> 00:45:39,180
Alaskan king crab.
Ow. I hate it when they do that.

800
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,881
Caesar salad. Ah!
Et tu, Brute? No.

801
00:45:41,955 --> 00:45:45,186
Aha. "To make a prince."

802
00:45:45,259 --> 00:45:47,489
Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.

803
00:45:47,561 --> 00:45:50,428
Genie, I wish for you
to make me a prince.

804
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,158
All right!

805
00:45:52,232 --> 00:45:53,563
Yo, yo! Woof! Woof!

806
00:45:53,634 --> 00:45:57,001
First, that fez-and-vest combo
is much too third century.

807
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:59,470
These patches.
What are we trying to say, beggar?

808
00:45:59,573 --> 00:46:02,041
No. Let's work with me here.

809
00:46:02,075 --> 00:46:05,203
Ooh. I like it. Muy macho.

810
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:08,180
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?

811
00:46:08,248 --> 00:46:11,046
It says mode of transportation.

812
00:46:11,118 --> 00:46:13,985
Excuse me, monkey boy.
Aqui. Over here.

813
00:46:14,054 --> 00:46:15,954
- Uh-oh.
- [Genie] Here he comes.

814
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,151
What better way to make your
entrance on the streets of Agrabah

815
00:46:19,226 --> 00:46:23,094
than riding your very own
brand-new camel.

816
00:46:23,163 --> 00:46:26,496
Watch out. They spit.
Mmm. Not enough.

817
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:28,762
Still not enough.

818
00:46:28,836 --> 00:46:30,633
Let's see.
What do you need?

819
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,332
Yes!

820
00:46:33,407 --> 00:46:36,774
Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo.

821
00:46:36,844 --> 00:46:38,869

00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,349
Abu, you look good.

826
00:46:50,424 --> 00:46:52,915
[Genie] He's got the outfit.
He's got the elephant.

827
00:46:52,993 --> 00:46:54,984
But we're not through yet.

828
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:59,692
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're gonna make you a star.

829
00:47:07,374 --> 00:47:08,500
[door opens]

830
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:12,238
Sire, I've found a solution
to the problem with your daughter.

831
00:47:12,312 --> 00:47:14,872
Awk. The problem with your daughter.

832
00:47:14,948 --> 00:47:16,176
Oh, really?

833
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,411
Right here.

834
00:47:18,485 --> 00:47:21,420
"If the princess has not chosen
a husband by the appointed time,

835
00:47:21,488 --> 00:47:25,891
then the sultan shall
choose for her."

836
00:47:25,959 --> 00:47:28,792
But Jasmine hated
all those suitors.

837
00:47:28,862 --> 00:47:31,092
How could I choose
someone she hates?

838
00:47:31,164 --> 00:47:34,133
Not to worry, my liege.
There is more.

839
00:47:34,201 --> 00:47:38,194
"If in the event
a suitable prince cannot be found,"

"a princess must then be wed to..."

842
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:45,810
Hmm. Interesting.

843
00:47:45,879 --> 00:47:47,642
What? Who?

844
00:47:47,714 --> 00:47:49,375
The royal vizier.

845
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:52,941
Why, that would be... me.

846
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,818
But I thought the law says

847
00:47:55,889 --> 00:47:58,255
that only a prince
can marry a princess.

848
00:47:58,358 --> 00:47:59,825
I'm quite sure that...

849
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:03,796
Desperate times call for
desperate measures, my lord.

850
00:48:03,864 --> 00:48:07,061
Yes. Desperate measures.

851
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:11,264
You will order
the princess to marry me.

852
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:13,602
I will order...

855
00:48:16,677 --> 00:48:19,111
But you're so old.

856
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:22,615
The princess will marry me.

857
00:48:22,683 --> 00:48:24,318
The princess will marry...

I'll like Princess Jasmine.

deciding my future?

Don't worry, Prince Ali.

Just give Jasmine time
to cool down.

to Prince Abooboo.

[Aladdin sighs] What am I gonna do?

960
00:53:56,216 --> 00:53:58,411
Jasmine won't even
let me talk to her.

That's a good move.

I can't believe it.
I'm losing to a rug.

Genie, I need help.

968
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,696
All right, Sparky,
here's the deal.

969
00:54:19,773 --> 00:54:21,798
If you wanna court
the little lady,

970
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:23,809
you gotta be
a straight shooter.

971
00:54:23,877 --> 00:54:25,811
- Do you got it?
- What?

972
00:54:25,879 --> 00:54:28,006
Tell her the...

973
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:29,912
...truth!
- No way.

974
00:54:29,983 --> 00:54:33,817
If Jasmine found out I was really
some crummy street rat,

975
00:54:33,887 --> 00:54:35,912
she'd laugh at me.

976
00:54:35,989 --> 00:54:38,480
Awoman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

977
00:54:39,259 --> 00:54:43,719
Al, all joking aside,
you really ought to be yourself.

978
00:54:43,797 --> 00:54:45,822
Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.

979
00:54:45,899 --> 00:54:47,867
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.

980
00:54:47,934 --> 00:54:52,564
I just... I gotta be smooth,
cool, confident.

981
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,800
How do I look?

982
00:54:56,576 --> 00:54:59,170
Like a prince.

983
00:55:07,921 --> 00:55:09,855
[sighs]

984
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,049
- [Aladdin] Princess Jasmine?
- [growling]

985
00:55:15,161 --> 00:55:18,153
- Who's there?
- It's me, Prince Ali.

986
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:21,598
Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

987
00:55:21,668 --> 00:55:23,397
I do not want to see you.

988
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:25,995
No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.

989
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,563
- [Jasmine] Just leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.

990
00:55:28,641 --> 00:55:31,132
So, how's our little beau doing?

991
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,006
- Good kitty, take off.
- [Rajah growling]

992
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,514
Down, kitty.

993
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:37,675
Wait. Wait.

994
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,151
Do I know you?

995
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,688
Uh, no. No.

996
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:47,056
You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.

997
00:55:47,127 --> 00:55:49,618
The marketplace?

998
00:55:49,696 --> 00:55:52,597
I have servants who go
to the marketplace for me.

999
00:55:52,665 --> 00:55:56,863
Why, I even have servants who go to
the marketplace for my servants.

1000
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:59,131
It couldn't have been me you met.

1001
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:02,834
No. I guess not.

1002
00:56:02,876 --> 00:56:05,538
[Genie] Enough about you, Casanova.
Talk about her.

1003
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:08,342
She's smart, fun,
the hair, the eyes.

1004
00:56:08,415 --> 00:56:10,007
Anything. Pick a feature.

1005
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:12,984
Ahem. Uh, Princess Jasmine?
You're very...

1006
00:56:13,053 --> 00:56:16,420
- Wonderful, magnificent, punctual.
...punctual.

1007
00:56:16,489 --> 00:56:17,615
- Punctual?
- Sorry.

1008
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:19,988
- Uh, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.

1009
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,118
Hmm.

1010
00:56:21,194 --> 00:56:23,424
I'm rich, too, you know.

1011
00:56:23,496 --> 00:56:26,431
- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.

1012
00:56:26,499 --> 00:56:28,490
I know.

1013
00:56:28,568 --> 00:56:32,231
Afine prize
for any prince to marry.

1014
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:35,274
Uh, right. Right.
A prince like me.

1015
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:36,501
Warning! Warning!

1016
00:56:36,576 --> 00:56:39,704
Right. A prince like you.

1017
00:56:39,779 --> 00:56:43,306
And every other stuffed shirt,
swaggering peacock I've met.

1018
00:56:43,383 --> 00:56:46,011
Mayday! Mayday!

1019
00:56:46,086 --> 00:56:48,748
[Jasmine] Just gojump off
a balcony!

1020
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,983
- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!

1021
00:56:51,057 --> 00:56:53,389
- Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.

1022
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:57,123
Okay, fine.
But remember, "bee" yourself.

1023
00:56:57,197 --> 00:56:58,994
- Yeah, right.
- What?

1024
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:01,294
Uh... Uh, you're right.

1025
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:06,605
[sighs] You aren'tjust
some prize to be won.

1026
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,506
[Aladdin] You should be free
to make your own choice.

1027
00:57:09,576 --> 00:57:10,873
I'll go now.

1028
00:57:10,944 --> 00:57:12,809
- No!
- What? What?

1029
00:57:12,879 --> 00:57:14,141
How...

1030
00:57:14,214 --> 00:57:16,774
How are you doing that?

1031
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,410
- It's a magic carpet.
- It's lovely.

1032
00:57:19,486 --> 00:57:20,520
- [kisses]
- You, uh...

1033
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,420
- [kisses]
- You, uh...

1034
00:57:22,489 --> 00:57:25,856
You don't want to go
for a ride, do you?

1035
00:57:25,925 --> 00:57:28,189
We could get out of the palace,
see the world.

1036
00:57:28,261 --> 00:57:31,424
- Is it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?

1037
00:57:32,298 --> 00:57:35,324
- What?
- Do you trust me?

1038
00:57:37,237 --> 00:57:38,905
Yes.

1039
00:57:38,905 --> 00:57:39,303
Yes.

1040

Oh, no.

You are the boy from the market.
I knew it.

No, that's not what I meant.

Tell me the truth.

The truth. Um...

The truth is...

1088
01:00:58,438 --> 01:01:01,100
I sometimes dress as a commoner, um...

1089
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,802
to escape the pressures
of palace life.

Why didn't you just tell me?

Hmm.

1096

Not that strange.

your welcome, Prince Abooboo.

Make sure he's never found.

[gasping] Al! Kid, snap out of it.

1114

You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help unless you make a wish.

1115
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:43,995
You have to say, "Genie,
I want you to save my life." Got it?

1116
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,402
Come on, Aladdin!

1117
01:03:46,472 --> 01:03:48,963
I'll take that as a yes.
[imitating alarm]

I...

- Thanks, Genie.
- Oh, Al.

01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,261
I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.

1126
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:16,961
Not that I wanna pick out
curtains or anything.

1127
01:04:17,036 --> 01:04:18,867
[humming]

1128
01:04:23,075 --> 01:04:25,043
[Sultan] Jasmine.

1129
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:29,377
Oh, Father, I just had
the most wonderful time.

1130
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:32,611
- [Jasmine] I'm so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.

1131
01:04:32,685 --> 01:04:35,051
I have chosen a husband for you.

1132
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:39,057
- What?
- You will wed Jafar.

1133
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,719
- [gasping]
- You're speechless, I see.

1134
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,659
Afine quality in a wife.

1135
01:04:43,729 --> 01:04:45,594
I will never marry you.

1136
01:04:45,665 --> 01:04:49,431
- Father, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali left.

1137
01:04:49,502 --> 01:04:51,766
Better check your
crystal ball again, Jafar.

1138
01:04:51,837 --> 01:04:53,566
- Prince Ali!
- [gasping]

1139
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:56,301
How in the... uh. Awk!

1140
01:04:56,375 --> 01:04:59,970
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.

1141
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:03,173
What? Ridiculous nonsense,
Your Highness.

1142
01:05:03,215 --> 01:05:05,479
He is obviously lying.

1143
01:05:05,551 --> 01:05:08,019
Obviously lying.

1144
01:05:08,087 --> 01:05:10,146
Father, what's wrong with you?

1145
01:05:10,222 --> 01:05:12,087
I know what's wrong.

1146
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:15,254
Oh, my!

1147
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,853
Jafar's been controlling you with this.

1148
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:20,922
[stammering] What? Jafar?

1149
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,968
You, you traitor!

1150
01:05:23,035 --> 01:05:25,265
Your Majesty,
all this can be explained.

1151
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,203
Guards! Guards!

1152
01:05:27,273 --> 01:05:29,969
Well, that's it.
We're dead. Forget it.

1153
01:05:30,042 --> 01:05:32,203
Just dig a grave for both of us.
We're dead.

1154
01:05:32,278 --> 01:05:34,712
- [Sultan] Arrest Jafar at once.
- [struggling]

1155
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:37,305
This is not done yet, boy.

1156
01:05:38,584 --> 01:05:40,279
- [laughing]
- [coughing]

1157
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,583
[Sultan] Find him!

1158
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:46,557
- [Sultan] Search everywhere!
- Jasmine, are you all right?

1159
01:05:46,626 --> 01:05:47,615
Yes.

1160
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:50,059
Jafar, my most trusted counselor,

1161
01:05:50,129 --> 01:05:52,222
plotting against me all this time.

1162
01:05:52,298 --> 01:05:54,459
This is horrible, just horrible.

1163
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:56,763
How will I ever...

1164
01:05:56,836 --> 01:05:58,861
Huh?

1165
01:05:58,971 --> 01:06:00,700
Can this be true?

1166
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:04,403
My daughter has finally
chosen a suitor?

1167
01:06:04,477 --> 01:06:07,708
Ha, ha! Praise Allah!

1168
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:11,816
You brilliant boy,
I could kiss you.

1169
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:14,079
I won't.
I'll leave that to my...

1170
01:06:14,153 --> 01:06:16,986
But you two will be wed at once.

1171
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:19,752
Yes, yes. And you'll be happy
and prosperous,

1172
01:06:19,825 --> 01:06:23,056
and then you, my boy,
will become sultan.

1173
01:06:23,129 --> 01:06:24,528
- Sultan?
- [Sultan] Yes.

1174
01:06:24,597 --> 01:06:26,724
Afine upstanding youth
such as yourself,

1175
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:29,267
a person of your
unimpeachable moral character

1176
01:06:29,335 --> 01:06:32,862
is exactly what this kingdom needs.

1177
01:06:32,938 --> 01:06:34,496
[lago] We gotta get outta here.

1178
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:36,939
I gotta start packing.
Only essentials.

1179
01:06:37,009 --> 01:06:38,374
We gotta travel light.

1180
01:06:38,444 --> 01:06:41,379
Bring the guns, the weapons,
and how about this picture?

1181
01:06:41,447 --> 01:06:44,245
I think I'm making a weird face in it.

1182
01:06:44,316 --> 01:06:47,513
[laughing maniacally]

1183
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:50,714
Oh, boy. He's cracked.
He's gone nuts.

1184
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:52,917
Jafar! Jafar!

1185
01:06:52,992 --> 01:06:54,391
Get a grip!

1186
01:06:55,361 --> 01:06:56,350
Good grip.

1187
01:06:56,429 --> 01:07:00,365
Prince Ali is nothing more than
that ragged urchin, Aladdin.

1188
01:07:00,466 --> 01:07:03,663
- He has the lamp, lago.
- Why, that miserable...

1189
01:07:03,703 --> 01:07:06,501
But you are going
to relieve him of it.

1190
01:07:06,572 --> 01:07:07,561
Me?

1191
01:07:11,477 --> 01:07:13,411
Sultan?

1192
01:07:13,479 --> 01:07:15,606
They want me to be Sultan?

1193
01:07:16,315 --> 01:07:17,680
Huzzah!

1194
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,514
"Hail the conquering hero

01:07:28,194 --> 01:07:31,163
Aladdin, you'vejust won
the heart of the princess.

1197
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:33,357
What are you gonna do next?

01:07:37,169 --> 01:07:38,534
[sighs deeply]

[whispering] Psst. Your line is,

1200
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:45,468
Anytime.

1201
01:07:45,544 --> 01:07:48,911
- Genie. I can't.
- Sure you can.

1202
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:52,508
You just go,
"Genie, I wish you free."

1203
01:07:52,585 --> 01:07:53,643
I'm serious.

1204
01:07:53,719 --> 01:07:57,712
Look, I'm sorry. I really am.
But they wanna make me sultan.

1205
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:01,452
No. They wanna make
Prince Ali sultan.

1206
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,826
Without you,
I'm just Aladdin.

1207
01:08:03,896 --> 01:08:06,023
- Al, you won.
- Because of you.

1208
01:08:06,098 --> 01:08:09,556
The only reason anyone thinks
I'm worth anything is because of you.

1209
01:08:09,635 --> 01:08:11,796
What if they find out
I'm not really a prince?

1210
01:08:11,871 --> 01:08:15,773
What if Jasmine finds out?
I'd lose her.

1211
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:19,140
Genie, I can't
keep this up on my own.

1212
01:08:19,211 --> 01:08:21,975
I can't wish you free.

1213
01:08:23,082 --> 01:08:26,916
Fine. I understand.
You've lied to everyone else.

1214
01:08:26,986 --> 01:08:28,783
Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.

1215
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:32,415
Now, if you'll excuse me, Master.

1216

Well, fine.
Then just stay in there.

1223
01:08:52,611 --> 01:08:54,670
Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't...

1224
01:08:54,747 --> 01:08:56,738
Wait. Come on.

1225
01:08:59,618 --> 01:09:02,143

1226
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,689
What am I doing?

[sighs] Genie's right.

1228
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:10,920
I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.

1229

Will you come here?

Where are you?

01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:41,325
- [imitates Jafar] Excellent work, lago.
- Ah, go on.

1240
01:09:41,393 --> 01:09:45,523
No, really. On a scale of
one to ten, you are an eleven.

1241
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:48,032
Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.

1242
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,068
I'm embarrassed.
I'm blushing.

Ali, where have you been?

1247
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:05,212
Jasmine, there's something
I got to tell you.

1248
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:08,253
The whole kingdom's turned out
for Father's announcement.

1249
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,618
No. But, Jasmine, listen to me, please.

1250
01:10:10,689 --> 01:10:12,680
- You don't understand...
- Good luck.

Look at them,
cheering that little pipsqueak.

1255
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:24,470
Let them cheer.

1256
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,665
Let them cheer.

1257
01:10:27,873 --> 01:10:30,774
You know, Al, I'm getting really...

1258
01:10:30,843 --> 01:10:33,368
I don't think you're him.
Tonight, the part of Al

1259
01:10:33,445 --> 01:10:36,710
will be played by a tall, dark
and sinister ugly man.

1260
01:10:36,782 --> 01:10:39,649
- I am your master now.
- I was afraid of that.

1261
01:10:39,718 --> 01:10:42,710
Genie, grant me my first wish.

1262
01:10:42,788 --> 01:10:46,656
I wish to rule on high as sultan.

1263
01:10:50,696 --> 01:10:53,893
- Whoa!
- Bless my soul.

1264
01:10:53,966 --> 01:10:55,866
What is this?

1265
01:10:55,935 --> 01:10:59,098
What's going on?
Oh, my goodness, what's happening?

1266
01:10:59,204 --> 01:11:01,195
Father.

1267
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,265
[cackling]

1268
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:06,505
Jafar, you vile betrayer.

1269
01:11:06,578 --> 01:11:09,547
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.

1270
01:11:09,615 --> 01:11:11,708
Oh, yeah?
We'll just see about that.

1271
01:11:11,784 --> 01:11:14,685
- [gasps] The lamp.

Sorry, kid.
I got a new master now.

1277
01:11:38,811 --> 01:11:42,008
Jafar, I order you to stop.

1278
01:11:42,081 --> 01:11:44,208
Ah, but there's a new order now.

1279
01:11:44,283 --> 01:11:46,080
My order.

1280
01:11:46,151 --> 01:11:49,211
Finally, you will bow to me.

1281
01:11:49,288 --> 01:11:51,222
We will never bow to you.

1282
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:53,417
Why am I not surprised?

1283
01:11:53,492 --> 01:11:55,960
If you won't bow before a sultan,

1284
01:11:56,028 --> 01:11:59,225
then you will cower
before a sorcerer!

1285
01:11:59,331 --> 01:12:01,595
Genie, my second wish...

1286
01:12:01,633 --> 01:12:06,036
I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer
in the world!

1287
01:12:07,873 --> 01:12:10,171
- [Jafar laughs maniacally]
- Genie, stop!

1288
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:13,177
Ladies and gentlemen,

1289
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:18,774
a warm Agrabah welcome
for Sorcerer Jafar!

1290
01:12:18,851 --> 01:12:20,842
Now, where were we?

1291
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:25,549
Ah, yes. Abject humiliation.

1292
01:12:26,959 --> 01:12:30,895
- Down, boy.
- [meows]

1293
01:12:30,963 --> 01:12:32,225
Oh, Princess.

1294
01:12:32,297 --> 01:12:35,198
There's someone I'm dying
to introduce you to.

1295
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:36,859
Jafar. Get your hands off her.

1296
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:38,926
"Prince Ali
Yes, it is he

1297
01:12:39,004 --> 01:12:41,131
"But not as you know him

1298
01:12:41,206 --> 01:12:45,438
"Read my lips
And come to grips with reality

1299
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,637
"Yes, meet a blast from your past

1300
01:12:48,714 --> 01:12:51,205
"Whose lies were too good to last

1301
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:54,741
"Say hello
To your precious Prince Ali

1302
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:57,414
Or should we say Aladdin?

1303
01:12:57,523 --> 01:12:58,512
Ali?

1304
01:12:58,557 --> 01:13:01,788
Jasmine, I tried to tell you.
I'm just...

1305
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:06,297
"So Ali turns out to be
Merely Aladdin

1306
01:13:06,365 --> 01:13:08,492
"Just a con, need I go on

1307
01:13:08,567 --> 01:13:10,865
"Take it from me

1308
01:13:10,936 --> 01:13:13,234
"His personality flaws

01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:15,330
"Give me adequate cause

1310
01:13:15,407 --> 01:13:18,308
"To send him packing
On a one-way trip

1311
01:13:18,377 --> 01:13:20,743
"So his prospects
Take a terminal dip

1312
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:25,978
"His assets frozen, the venue chosen
Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!

1313
01:13:26,051 --> 01:13:28,451
- So long!
- Good-bye, see ya.

1314
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:32,547
"Ex-Prince Ali"

1315
01:13:34,026 --> 01:13:35,857
[laughing maniacally]

1316
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,510
[wind howling]

1317
01:13:55,581 --> 01:13:57,139
[shivering]

1318
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:00,243
Abu.

1319
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,515
Abu!

1320
01:14:04,456 --> 01:14:06,424
[Abu whimpering]

1321
01:14:07,292 --> 01:14:09,692
Oh, this is all my fault.

1322
01:14:09,761 --> 01:14:13,959
I should have freed the genie
when I had the chance. Abu.

1323
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:17,490
- Are you okay?
- [teeth chattering] Mm-hmm.

1324
01:14:17,569 --> 01:14:19,503
I'm sorry, Abu.

1325
01:14:19,571 --> 01:14:22,301
I made a mess of everything.

1326
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:25,969
Somehow... I gotta go back
and set things right.

1327
01:14:33,485 --> 01:14:35,817
Carpet.

1328
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:39,016
- [Abu chitters]
- [Aladdin strains]

1329
01:14:39,691 --> 01:14:41,556
Abu, start digging.

1330
01:14:41,627 --> 01:14:42,753
[frantic panting]

1331
01:14:43,996 --> 01:14:45,861
That's it.

1332
01:15:03,148 --> 01:15:06,117
Yeah! All right!

1333
01:15:06,185 --> 01:15:08,210
[whines]

1334
01:15:11,356 --> 01:15:14,291
Now, back to Agrabah.
Let's go.

1335
01:15:17,196 --> 01:15:19,926
- [lago] Puppet ruler want a cracker?
- [Sultan moaning]

1336
01:15:19,998 --> 01:15:22,796
Here's your cracker.
Shoved all the way down your throat.

1337
01:15:22,868 --> 01:15:24,199
Here. Have lots.

1338
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:27,898
Stop it.
Jafar, leave him alone.

1339
01:15:27,973 --> 01:15:29,873
[growling]

1340
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:34,003
It pains me to see you
reduced to this, Jasmine.

1341
01:15:35,914 --> 01:15:38,382
A beautiful desert bloom
such as yourself

1342
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:42,318
should be on the arm of the most
powerful man in the world.

1343
01:15:42,387 --> 01:15:44,321
What do you say, my dear?

1344
01:15:44,389 --> 01:15:47,153
Why, with you as my queen...

1345
01:15:47,226 --> 01:15:49,285
- Never.
- [enraged growl]

1346
01:15:49,361 --> 01:15:52,023
I'll teach you some respect.

1347
01:15:52,097 --> 01:15:53,325
[gasping]

1348
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:56,994
No. Genie.

1349
01:15:58,070 --> 01:16:00,595
I have decided
to make my final wish.

1350
01:16:00,672 --> 01:16:03,664
I wish for Princess Jasmine

1351
01:16:03,742 --> 01:16:06,734
to fall desperately
in love with me.

1352
01:16:12,517 --> 01:16:16,510
Ah, Master, there are a few addendas,
some quid pro quo...

1353
01:16:16,588 --> 01:16:18,647
Don't talk back to me,
you big blue lout.

1354
01:16:18,724 --> 01:16:23,752
[Jafar] You will do what
I order you to do, slave.

1355
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,764
[Jasmine] Jafar.

1356
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:32,737
I never realized how...
incredibly handsome you are.

1357
01:16:34,406 --> 01:16:37,170
Mmm. That's better.

1358
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:40,974
Now, pussycat...

1359
01:16:41,046 --> 01:16:44,038
tell me more about myself.

1360
01:16:44,116 --> 01:16:47,142
You're tall...

1361
01:16:47,219 --> 01:16:49,551
dark...

1362
01:16:49,621 --> 01:16:51,646
well dressed...

1363
01:16:51,723 --> 01:16:54,055
Al. Al, little buddy.

1364
01:16:54,126 --> 01:16:56,686
Shh.

1365
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,559
Al, I can't help you.

1366
01:17:00,632 --> 01:17:03,396
I work for Senor Psychopath now.
What are you gonna do?

1367
01:17:03,468 --> 01:17:07,529
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?
I'll improvise.

1368
01:17:07,606 --> 01:17:11,167
[Jasmine]... cute little gaps
between your teeth.

1369
01:17:11,243 --> 01:17:13,177
Go on.

1370
01:17:13,245 --> 01:17:15,770
And your beard...

1371
01:17:15,847 --> 01:17:19,010
is so... twisted.

1372
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:24,386
- You've stolen my heart.
- [gasping] Jaf...!

1373
01:17:24,456 --> 01:17:28,153
- [lago mumbling]
- And the street rat?

1374
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:30,956
What street rat?

1375
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:35,624
- [clattering]
- [gasping]

1376
01:17:37,336 --> 01:17:38,735
[gasping]

1377
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:40,727
[both] Yech!

1378
01:17:42,007 --> 01:17:44,066
That was...

1379
01:17:46,345 --> 01:17:47,334
You!

1380
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:52,706
How many times
do I have to kill you, boy?

1381
01:17:55,654 --> 01:17:57,212
Get the lamp.

1382
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:00,349
No!

1383
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:03,087
Ah, ah, ah, Princess.
Your time is up.

1384
01:18:03,161 --> 01:18:05,561
[growling]

1385
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:08,994
Jasmine.

1386
01:18:09,668 --> 01:18:11,829
Oh, nice shot, Jaf...

1387
01:18:13,372 --> 01:18:15,772
Don't toy with me.

1388
01:18:16,675 --> 01:18:18,302
Abu!

1389
01:18:18,377 --> 01:18:21,710
[Jafar] Things are unraveling
fast now, boy.

1390
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,544
[Jafar laughing]

1391
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:26,311
Get the point?

1392
01:18:26,385 --> 01:18:28,148
[laughing]

1393
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,881
[straining]

1394
01:18:32,357 --> 01:18:34,985
I'm just getting warmed up.

1395
01:18:37,329 --> 01:18:40,628
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?

1396
01:18:40,699 --> 01:18:40,799
A snake, am I?

1397
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:43,632
A snake, am I?

1398
01:18:43,702 --> 01:18:48,503
Perhaps you'd like to see
how snakelike I can be.

1399
01:19:04,589 --> 01:19:05,851
[screaming]

1400
01:19:05,924 --> 01:19:08,188
"Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake
Stick that sword into that snake

1401
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:09,818
You stay out of this.

1402
01:19:09,895 --> 01:19:13,296
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... great!

1403
01:19:17,602 --> 01:19:19,229
[Jasmine] Aladdin.

1404
01:19:25,444 --> 01:19:26,706
[screams]

1405
01:19:28,747 --> 01:19:31,011
Jasmine, hang on.

1406
01:19:32,551 --> 01:19:36,351
[laughing] You little fool.

1407
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:41,724
You thought you could defeat
the most powerful being on Earth.

1408
01:19:42,794 --> 01:19:46,059
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a... Awk!

1409
01:19:46,131 --> 01:19:50,158
Without the genie, boy,
you're nothing.

1410
01:19:50,235 --> 01:19:53,398
The genie. The genie.

1411
01:19:53,472 --> 01:19:56,339
The genie has more power
than you'll ever have.

1412
01:19:56,408 --> 01:19:57,432
What?

1413
01:19:57,509 --> 01:19:59,909
He gave you your power.
He can take it away.

1414
01:19:59,978 --> 01:20:02,708
Al, what are you doing?
Why are you bringing me into this?

1415
01:20:02,781 --> 01:20:06,547
Face it, Jafar.
You're still just second best.

1416
01:20:06,618 --> 01:20:08,984
You're right.

1417
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:12,820
His power does exceed my own.

1418
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:15,018
But not for long.

1419
01:20:15,093 --> 01:20:18,221
The boy is crazy.
He's a little punch-drunk.

1420
01:20:18,296 --> 01:20:19,888
One too many hits with the snake.

1421
01:20:19,965 --> 01:20:22,866
Slave, I make my third wish.

1422
01:20:22,934 --> 01:20:27,200
I wish to be
an all-powerful genie!

1423
01:20:30,876 --> 01:20:34,642
All right, your wish is my command.
Way to go, Al.

1424
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:42,346
Yes.

1425
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:45,253
Yes!

1426
01:20:45,323 --> 01:20:46,950
The power.

1427
01:20:47,025 --> 01:20:50,017
- [Jafar laughs]
- [Jasmine coughs]

1428
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:53,963
The absolute power!

1429
01:20:54,799 --> 01:20:57,267
- What have you done?
- Trust me.

1430
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:02,468
The universe is mine to command,
to control!

1431
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:06,372
Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?

1432
01:21:06,444 --> 01:21:08,708
- Huh?
- You wanted to be a genie...

1433
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,077
you got it.

1434
01:21:10,148 --> 01:21:11,410
What?

1435
01:21:11,483 --> 01:21:13,815
And everything that goes with it.

1436
01:21:13,885 --> 01:21:17,446
- No! No!
- I'm gettin' out of here.

1437
01:21:17,522 --> 01:21:19,547
[Aladdin] Phenomenal cosmic powers...

1438
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:22,752
You're the genie. I don't want...

1439
01:21:22,827 --> 01:21:24,129
Itty bitty living space.

1440
01:21:24,429 --> 01:21:27,421
Al, you little genius, you.

1441
01:21:35,006 --> 01:21:37,065
- Ahh!
- [meow]

1442
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:44,839
[Jafar] Get your blasted beak
out of my face.

1443
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:48,181
- [lago] Oh, shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

1444
01:21:48,253 --> 01:21:49,584
Allow me.

1445
01:21:49,654 --> 01:21:54,023
10,000 years in a Cave of Wonders
ought to chill him out.

1446
01:21:54,092 --> 01:21:58,324
- [lago yelling, indistinct]
- [Jafar] Shut up!

1447
01:22:03,568 --> 01:22:05,468
Jasmine...

1448
01:22:05,537 --> 01:22:09,029
I'm sorry I lied to you
about being a prince.

1449
01:22:09,107 --> 01:22:11,769
I know why you did.

1450
01:22:11,843 --> 01:22:14,505
Well, I guess...

1451
01:22:14,579 --> 01:22:17,548
this is good-bye?

1452
01:22:17,616 --> 01:22:20,847
Oh, that stupid law.
This isn't fair.

1453
01:22:20,919 --> 01:22:22,546
I love you.

1454
01:22:22,621 --> 01:22:25,522
[sniffles] Al, no problem.

1455
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:27,558
You've still got one wish left.

1456
01:22:27,626 --> 01:22:29,856
Just say the word
and you're a prince again.

1457
01:22:29,928 --> 01:22:31,953
But, Genie,
what about your freedom?

1458
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:35,124
Hey, it's only
an eternity of servitude.

1459
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,168
This is love.

1460
01:22:37,235 --> 01:22:41,638
Al, you're not gonna find another girl
like her in a million years.

1461
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:45,540
Believe me, I know.
I've looked.

1462
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:47,339
Jasmine, I do love you,

1463
01:22:47,412 --> 01:22:51,246
but I got to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.

1464
01:22:51,316 --> 01:22:53,648
I understand.

1465
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,378
Genie, I wish for your freedom.

1466
01:22:57,489 --> 01:23:00,549
One bona fide
prince pedigree coming up.

1467
01:23:00,592 --> 01:23:04,528
- What?
- Genie, you're free.

1468
01:23:24,549 --> 01:23:27,541
I'm free. I'm free.

1469
01:23:27,619 --> 01:23:30,144
Quick. Quick.
Wish for something outrageous.

1470
01:23:30,221 --> 01:23:32,416
Say, "I want the Nile." Try that.

1471
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:35,288
- Uh, I wish for the Nile.
- No way!

1472
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:36,759
[laughing gleefully]

1473
01:23:36,828 --> 01:23:39,422
Oh, does that feel good! Oh!

1474
01:23:39,497 --> 01:23:42,762
I'm free! I'm free at last!

1475
01:23:42,834 --> 01:23:45,325
I'm hittin' the road.
I'm off to see the world.

1476
01:23:45,403 --> 01:23:47,132
I'm...

1477
01:23:54,479 --> 01:23:56,470
Genie, I'm...

1478
01:23:56,548 --> 01:23:59,142
I'm gonna miss you.

1479
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:02,515
Me, too, Al.
[sniffles]

1480
01:24:02,554 --> 01:24:05,682
No matter
what anybody says,

1481
01:24:05,757 --> 01:24:08,817
you'll always be a prince to me.

1482
01:24:08,893 --> 01:24:11,054
That's right.

1483
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:14,064
You've certainly proven your worth
as far as I'm concerned.

1484
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:17,533
It's that law
that's the problem.

1485
01:24:17,602 --> 01:24:20,901
- Father?
- Well, am I Sultan or am I Sultan?

1486
01:24:20,972 --> 01:24:22,564
From this day forth,

1487
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:27,304
the princess shall marry
whomever she deems worthy.

1488
01:24:27,378 --> 01:24:29,846
Him. I choose...

1489
01:24:31,116 --> 01:24:34,483
I choose you, Aladdin.

1490
01:24:35,553 --> 01:24:37,487
Call me Al.

1491
01:24:38,923 --> 01:24:42,154
Oh, all of ya, come over here.
Big group hug.

1492
01:24:42,227 --> 01:24:43,819
Group hug.

1493
01:24:43,895 --> 01:24:45,863
Mind if I kiss the monkey?

1494
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:47,261
Ooh, hairball.

1495
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:50,358
Well, I can't do any more damage
around this Popsicle stand.

1496
01:24:50,435 --> 01:24:52,426
I'm outta here!

1497
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,938
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!

1498
01:24:55,006 --> 01:24:57,839
Hey, Rugman, ciao.
I'm history.

1499
01:24:57,942 --> 01:24:59,466
No, I'm mythology.

1500
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:02,537
I don't care what I am. I'm free!

1501
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:08,108
"A whole new world

1502
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:10,677
"A whole new life

1503
01:25:10,755 --> 01:25:14,418
"For you and me

1504
01:25:17,095 --> 01:25:19,928
"A whole new world"

1505
01:25:29,574 --> 01:25:31,508
[laughing]

1506
01:25:32,977 --> 01:25:34,444
Made you look.
