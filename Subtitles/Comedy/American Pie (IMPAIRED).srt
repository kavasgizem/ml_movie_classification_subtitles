- Working with the choir chick ?

What d'ya say, fellas ? I just dig
those cute little sweaters she wears.

[ Laughing, Shouting Continue ]

593
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,000
I was being selfish
and majorly insensitive.

594
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm a-- I'm a total idiot.
I mean, a fool, a buffoon.

I'm a shithead, and I want to make it up to you.

- Oh, Jim !
- Dad.

00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,000
Hi, I was just looking
at the old family portrait out here.

614
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,000
Well, that was
a fun day wasn't it ?

615
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,000
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

616
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,000
Jim, I want to talk
about masturbation.

617
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,000
Now, I just want you to know that
it's-it's a perfectly normal, uh, thing.

618
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,000
And I have
to admit, uh, you know.

619
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:20,000
I did a fair bit of masturbating
when I was a little younger.

620
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,000
- I, uh-- I used to call it
"stroking the salami." - [ Groans ]

621
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,000
Yeah, you know,
"pounding the ol' pud."

622
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,000
I never did it
with baked goods.

623
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,000
But you know your Uncle Mort ?
He "pinched the one-eyed snake" five, six times a day.

624
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,000
See, it's like, uh,
practice for the big game.

625
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,000
You see ?
It's like-- It's like...

626
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,000
banging a tennis ball
against a brick wall.

627
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,000
Which can be fun.
It can be fun, but it's not a game.

628
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,000
- Right. No.
- It's not a game.

629
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,000
What you want is you want
a partner to return the ball.

630
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,000
- Do you want a partner ?
- Yeah. Yeah-Yeah, I want a partner.

631
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,000
- You do want a partner ?
- Oh, I want a partner.

632
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,000
- Want a partner. Good. Good.
- Of course.

633
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,000
Good.

634
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,000
So, once Hal becomes king,
he has to take on...

635
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,000
the responsibilities of leadership
and turn his back...

636
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,000
on his old,
drunken friend, Falstaff.

637
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,000
You see, Hal is going through a...
rite of passage, much like you all are.

638

So make most of the time you've got
left together. You'll miss it later.

get this sudden reputation ?

- What reputation ?
- Observe.

know how he's doing it.

just leaves Jim trailing.

Uh, yeah. Absolutely.

- Well, I have ballet practice.

666
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,000
Perhaps I could come
by your house afterwards ?

667
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,000
I could change
clothes at your place.

Oh. Uh... yeah.

669
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,000
I suppose that
would be okay. Sure.

No, I like the car.
By the way, though, about prom ?

00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,000
That was a bad idea.
I'm sorry I invited you.

- What are you talkin' about ?
- Please.

675
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,000
I asked you because I thought you might
actually be worth going with.

But you are just a jock.
No, wait. You're a jerk.

Wait !
I don't understand.

678
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,000
I saw you making fun of me
with your lacrosse buddies.

makin' fun of you.

Fuck me ! There's gonna be an Eastern
European chick naked in your house.

And you're not gonna
do anything about that ?

683

What am I gonna do, huh ?
Broadcast her over the lnternet ?

No. I cannot do that to her.

to photograph a naked chick, how you gonna sleep with one ?

I don't like the kid,
but he's got a point.

See, even shit-brick
knows you should do it.

All you gotta do is set up some sort of

and tell me the address.

and I want that part to smoke.

Yeah, I know,
my timing's off.

702

No, it's not that. I think it'll
work better as a duet with a tenor part.

and thank you, baby -**-**

- Hey, minute man !
- Shut up.

You know-- You know you're
supposed to be supportive.

881
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,000
Hey, you think you still
got a chance with Nadia ?

882
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,000
No. Her sponsors here
saw the thing on the 'Net.

883
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,000
I-l really don't
think they liked it.

884

Yeah.

00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:06,000
You know, guys ? Maybe I'm just
not good with girls, period.

888
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,000
No-no-no, really-really. Like-- Like I
was born without that part of the brain.

889
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,000
I mean, I can't
talk to girls.

890
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,000
And when I do talk
to them, I screw it up.

891
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,000
Yeah, well, come prom those excuses
aren't going to do you any good.

- [ Sighs ]
- [ Michelle ] And one time at band camp,

893
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,000
we weren't supposed
to have pillow fights,

894
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,000
but we had a pillow fight,
and it was so much fun.

895
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:33,000
A-And this one time, we all
lost our music and we were supposed to play this song,

896
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:38,000
but we didn't know it, so we just made
it up and we kept playing and playing,

897
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,000
and the conductor didn't know
what we were doing, and it was so funny.

898
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,000
-So, you're pissed about somethin', huh.
-[ Scoffs ]

899
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,000
You know what
I do when I'm angry ?

900
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,000
I just play some Bach on my flute.
It's so relaxing.

901
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,000
- I learned to do that at band camp.
- Hold on, uh--

902
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,000
You have no idea
why I'm angry ?

903
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,000
Is it because we have a test tomorrow ?
Sometimes I get cranky...

904
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,000
- when I know I have
a big test to study for. - [ Laughs ]

905
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,000
- Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty much it.
- I thought so...

906
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,000
- because this one time at band camp--
- W-What's your name ?

907
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,000
- Michelle.
- O-Okay.

908
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,000
Michelle, um--

909
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,000
[ Chuckles ] Do you want to be
my date for the prom ?

910
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:21,000
Really ? You seriously
want to go with me ?

911
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,000
Yes. Seriously.

912
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,000
Are we going to Steve Stifler's
party afterwards ? Because that would be so cool.

913
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:36,000
- Sure, whatever you want.
- Cool ! We're gonna have such a good time.

914
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:42,000
It'll be like this one time at band camp
when we all had a campfire--

[ Knocking At Door ]

916
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,000
[ Siren Wailing, Distant ]

917
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,000
Hi.

918
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,000
- How'd you know I was here ?
- Stifler told me.

919
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:07,000
- Talked to Stifler ?
- Well, I needed to find you.

920
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,000
We're gonna have
to work on that song.

921
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,000
Okay.
I'm glad you came by.

922
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,000
So you work nights ?

923
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,000
- My dad's the manager.
- Really ?

924
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,000
Cool. Tell him
the subs are great.

925
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,000
-So you're going to Michigan next year ?
-Yeah.

926
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,000
My parents want me to go
to Northwestern, but...

927
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,000
I don't wanna write all those
extra essays they make you do.

928
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:40,000
I mean, how am I supposed to
know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was ?

929
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:45,000
So when my "U" of "M" acceptance came in
December, I just said the hell with it.

930
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,000
- Onions ?
- What ?

931
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,000
You, uh, want onions ?

932
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,000
Oh, no, thank you.

933
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,000
So what are you
gonna major in ?

934
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,000
State's got a good business
school, and I could probably walk-on to the lacrosse team.

935
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,000
Well, you've probably got it
pretty figured out, then, huh ?

936
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,000
I mean, business is okay,
and lacrosse is awesome, but...

937
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,000
what am I gonna be,
a professional lacrosse player ?

938
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,000
I really have no idea.

939
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,000
Thank God.
I thought I was the only one.

940
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,000
Well, you're not.

941
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,000
So we're gonna be
close next year.

942
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,000
You mean East Lansing
and Ann Arbor ?

943
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,000
Yeah.
[ Chuckling ]

944

[ Stifler ] What are you
talkin' about ?

945
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,000
I can't go to the prom with you.
I'm holding out for someone else.

946
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,000
[ Laughing ]
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

947
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:49,000
I know it's a long shot, but I figure
Paul Finch might ask me.

948
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,000
Finch.
Shit-brick.

949
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,000
Oh, gosh.
I-l forgot.

950
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,000
[ Stammering ]
You look okay.

951
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:02,000
I-l mean, the scars
healed really well.

952
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,000
- Hey, Stifler.
- Eat shit.

953
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,000
What was that
all about ?

954
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:13,000
- He's still embarrassed
because Finch kicked his ass. - Who told you that ?

955
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,000
What do you mean,
"no comment" ?

956
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,000
- Did you two hook up or something ?
- What, are you kidding ? No.

957
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:22,000
Then how did all this
get started ?

958
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,000
Well, I guess it's all right
for me to tell you now.

959
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:29,000
That reputation of his isn't
going anywhere. Cheese, please.

960
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,000
Finch comes up to me
and says, "Jessica,

961
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,000
I need your help with this,
blah, blah, etcetera."

962
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,000
So I said, "All right.
Pay me 200 bucks,

963
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,000
and I'll tell a couple of girls
that you're dynamite in bed."

964
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,000
So he did,
and I did.

965
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,000
- That actually works ?
- Well, duh ! Of course.

966
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,000
Naturally, I embellished
a little bit.

967
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,000
Did you hear that Finch had
an affair with an older woman ?

968
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,000
[ Chuckling ]
No, I didn't hear that one.

969
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,000
That one was my favorite.

970
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,000
[ Laughing ]
Do that cheerleader.

971
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,000
- -** Thank you, baby -**
- She wants me. She calls me up--

972
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:05,000
-** How sweet it is
to be loved by you -**-**

973
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,000
Oh, my God,
you're gay !

974
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,000
Sing it with me.
You know the words.

975
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,000
No, thanks, man. You've been
singin' that shit all week.

976
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:17,000
If you try that at M.S.U.
this Saturday, I'll kick your ass.

977
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,000
Our last game
is this Saturday.

978
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,000
[ Snickers ]
Yeah, well, shit.

979
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:28,000
I've got this lacrosse game. It's
really important. It's our last game.

980
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:32,000
Central almost beat us last time, so
this time I really wanna kick their ass.

981
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,000
But it's gonna be cool,
because the game's at State,

982
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,000
which means afterwards
I'll be able to stop by.

983
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,000
So you can't sing
at the competition.

984
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,000
[ Sighing ] Heather, I'm sorry.
I totally blew it.

985

It's okay. You should...
do what makes you happy.

986
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,000
All right. Listen,
thanks for understanding.

987
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,000
Yeah.

988
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,000
So, uh, I guess
I'll see you later ?

whose ass he kicked.

But, uh, I'll tell you
one thing, though.

I don't think he's gonna have a problem
shitting in school anymore.

about sex.

1173
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:48,000
No. Come on.
We made a pact.

1174
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:51,000
You can't break that.
You guys are gonna have to--

1175
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:55,000
Have to what, Kev, huh ?
I don't have to do shit.

1176
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:59,000
Forget it already. I am so sick
and tired of all this bullshit pressure.

1177
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:03,000
I've never even had sex, and already,
I can't stand it. I hate sex !

1178
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,000
And I'm not gonna stand around here
busting my balls over something that,

1179
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,000
quite frankly,
isn't that damn important.

1180
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,000
I'm gonna go hang out
with that geek over there...

1181
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:14,000
'cause at least she has something else
to talk about besides sex.

1182
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,000
Goddamn.

1183
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,000
Yeah.

1184
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:24,000
You know, at least I learned
how to shit in school, buddy.

1185
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,000
Hey, Finch.

1186
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,000
- Wanna dance ?
- Yeah.

1187
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:33,000
-** Oooh -**

1188
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:38,000
- How come you have no date ?
- I like to keep my options open.

1189
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,000
I got something for you.

1190
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,000
Consider it
a consolation prize.

1191
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:51,000
Jessica, this is great !
Wow !

1192
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:55,000
- Felt sorta guilty

1193
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,000
No, I spent 50 on the flask,
150 on the earrings.

1194
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,000
- These are, uh--
- Let me just clarify...

1195
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:07,000
- that you have no chance
of scoring with me, Finch. - Of course not !

1196
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,000
So I take it you and Sherman
are pretty close, huh ?

1197
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,000
You met at that party
a while back, right ?

1198
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,000
Yeah, we were
up all night together.

1199
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,000
We had one of those
amazingly deep conversations...

1200
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,000
where you feel like
you really get to know someone.

1201

[ Chuckling ]
Deep conversation, huh ?

1202
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,000
Is that
what you call it ?

1203
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,000
What else
would I call it ?

1204
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,000
Thank you, Great Falls.

1205
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,000
We're gonna take a little break.
You are beautiful.

01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,000
Excuse me, everyone.

1209
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,000
Sorry to interrupt.

1210
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:56,000
I just thought
you all should know this.

1211
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,000
Chuck Sherman is a liar.

1212
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,000
I never had sex with him.

1213
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:05,000
He's never had sex with anyone.
I know this because he told me.

1214
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,000
Once he tried to screw
a grapefruit, but that's all.

1215
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:13,000
Oh. He also told me that when he gets
nervous, he sometimes wets his pants.

1216
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:17,000
- Thank you for your time.

- Not interested.

to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.

- [ Jim ] What ?

1221
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:43,000
Why not ?

1222
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:48,000
Look, things didn't really
turn out how I wanted them to.

1223
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,000
I mean, I don't even
know what I'm doin'.

1224

I-l'm acting like I've got
everything together tonight.

1225

I know that Vicky's gonna
ask me if I love her, and...

1226
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,000
I don't know
what I'm gonna say.

1227
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,000
I mean,
I'm on the brink.

1228
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:05,000
I'm just about to do it.
I should be psyched.

1229
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:09,000
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am just scared.

1230
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:13,000
[ Scoffs ] Come on, Kev.
Tonight is the night.

1231
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:17,000
We-We are finally going
to a post-prom party on the lake.

1232
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,000
We have been waiting for this
for four years.

1233
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,000
Why else have we been friends
with Stifler all this time, right ?

1234
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:26,000
We were friends
with Stifler ?

1235
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,000
Hey, look.

1236
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:32,000
Sherman didn't even
get laid.

1237
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,000
- He didn't ?
- No, he pissed himself.

- [ Laughing ]
- What ?

1239

We'll tell you
on the bus.

1240
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:44,000
I'm gonna go inside
and grab my bag.

1241
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,000
My date too, perhaps ?

got it in the divorce.

[ Michelle ] That reminds me
of this one time--

1244
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,000
Hey, can I ask you
a question ?

1245
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,000
How come you don't have any stories ?
I've got lots of them,

1246
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,000
and you don't have any.

1247
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:03,000
Oh, I've got stories.
Believe me. They're just, uh--

1248
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:06,000
They're just a little
more risque than tales of band camp.

1249
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:11,000
Are they gross or something ?
Like guy stuff ? Tell me !

1250
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,000
Okay.
You want a story ?

1251

There's something
I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.

What's that ?

It's gonna sound
really bad, but, uh,

1262

I want you to know.

1263
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,000
You see, uh,

1264
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:24,000
I'm a virgin,
and, uh--

1265
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,000
Well, me, Kevin, Jim
and Finch were--

1266
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:29,000
We all made this pact...

1267
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:32,000
that we would
lose our virginity...

1268
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,000
before high school
was over,

1269
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,000
and tonight is supposed
to be the night that we all do it.

1270
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,000
This isn't the best way
to proposition me.

1271
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:44,000
No, that's--
That's not what I mean.

1272
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,000
W-What I mean is, uh--

1273
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,000
Look, do you know
what made me leave that game ?

1274
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:54,000
See, Coach, he was givin' us
this speech about...

1275
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,000
not slacking off when you see
the opportunity to score--

1276
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,000
This isn't any better,
Chris.

1277
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,000
No, you see--
You see, Heather,

1278
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:04,000
what I realized is that...

1279
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:09,000
with you, it's...
not like I'm running towards a goal...

1280
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,000
Iooking for
the best way to score.

1281
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:16,000
This may sound
a little corny, but...

1282
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,000
I feel like
I've already won.

1283
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:25,000
And, uh,
I care about you a lot.

1284
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:29,000
Oz, I know.

1285
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:33,000
- You called me Oz.
- Well, yeah.

1286
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,000
It's what your friends
call you.

1287
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:38,000
I mean, I feel like I'm
one of your friends now.

1288
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:42,000
And... your girlfriend ?

1289
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:49,000
-** Ain't never thought that
I could love like this -**

1290
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:52,000
-** This feeling inside me
is growing -**

you would care -**-**

Are ya lost ?

1293
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:25,000
You're Stifler's mom.
Uh--

1294
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,000
No, no, not lost.
Just, um,

1295
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,000
you know,
taking the tour.

1296
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:37,000
Hey, uh, thank you for letting
us have this wonderful party.

1297
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,000
As if there was
an alternative in the matter.

1298
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:47,000
So, you enjoying yourself ?

1299
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,000
I'm... three sheets
to the wind, ma'am.

1300
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,000
I'm so happy for you.

1301
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:55,000
But it takes the edge off,
doesn't it ?

1302
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:00,000
- Where's your little date tonight ?
- No date. It was--

1303
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,000
It was a bathroom incident.

1304
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:07,000
- Pardon me ?
- Never mind.

1305
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,000
You have
anything to drink ?

1306
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,000
I believe the kegs
are upstairs.

1307
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,000
That is what
the cretins drink.

1308
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,000
I'm talking about
alcohol, liquor.

1309
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:24,000
- The good stuff.
- All right.

1310
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,000
I got some scotch.

1311

- Single malt ?
- Aged 18 years.

1312

The way I like it.

1313
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:41,000
Why don't you go
grab a glass from the bar ?

1314
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:46,000
I think I should.

1315
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,000
Allow me.

1316
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,000
You know it's
a bitchin' party.

1317

always comes through in the clutch.

puked his brains out.

- That is a nasty story.
- Yep, I told you.

1320
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,000
Do you want to hear
a nasty story of mine ?

1321
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,000
It's sort of sexual.

1322
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:13,000
Yeah !
Yeah, let's hear it.

1323
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:18,000
Okay, well, this one time at band camp,
we were playing this game.

1324
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,000
I don't know if you know it,
but it's called "Spin the Bottle."

1325
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:25,000
And I had to kiss this guy
named Mark Wander on the lips.

1326
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,000
And-And he plays
trombone--

1327
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:30,000
[ Kevin ] So how do you
want to be ?

1328
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:33,000
Like... how do you
want to do it ?

1329
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:37,000
I don't know.
How do you ?

1330
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:42,000
Like... normal style.
The missionary position.

1331
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,000
Okay.

1332
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,000

-** Don't ever go away -**

1340
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:29,000
-** I should be
much too smart for this -**

1341
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:32,000
-** You know it gets
the better of me -**

1342
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:36,000
-** Sometimes
when you and I collide -**

1343
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:39,000
- -** I fall into an ocean of you -**
- Oh. My hair.

1347
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,000
You okay ?

1348
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:52,000
Yeah. Go slow.

1349
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,000
-** Say you'll stay -**

1350
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:58,000
-** Don't come and go -**

1351
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,000
-** Like you do -**

1352
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,000
-** Sway my way -**

1353

-** Say you'll stay -**-**

1356
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,000
So the end of the story
is you...

1357
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,000
had to kiss the guy
for 20 seconds.

1358
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:24,000
Yes ! And he was such a dork.
Everyone laughed at me...

1359
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:28,000
- but I didn't care
because it was so funny. - I get it.

1360
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:32,000
And this one time at band camp,
I stuck a flute in my pussy.

1361
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,000
Hmm.
[ Sputters ]

[ Coughs ]
Excuse me ?

1363

What ? You don't think I know
how to get myself off ?

1364
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:43,000
Hell, that's what
half of band camp is-- Sex Ed.

1365
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:46,000
So are we gonna screw soon,
'cause I'm gettin' kinda antsy.

1366
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,000
This'll do. Whoo-hoo !

1368
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,000
Now, I have two rubbers.
Wear them both. It'll desensitize you.

Now, I have two rubbers.
Wear them both. It'll desensitize you.

1370
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,000
I don't want you coming
so damn early this time.

1371
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:15,000
What makes you think
that I would come early ?

1372
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:19,000
Come on. I saw you on the 'Net.
Why do you think I accepted this date ?

1373
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:22,000
- You're a sure thing.
- [ Scoffs ]

Yes, I am.

1375
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:31,000
So I said, "This is very obviously
a Piero della Francesca."

1376

[ Laughing ]
Hmm.

1377
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:44,000
So, uh, would you object if I said
that you were quite striking ?

1378
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:49,000
Mr. Finch, are you
trying to seduce me ?

Yeah.

I mean, I just can't believe
we had our senior prom.

I know.
It went by so fast.

is that...
nothing's perfect.

plan everything.

Well, I guess... you will
be pretty far away.
