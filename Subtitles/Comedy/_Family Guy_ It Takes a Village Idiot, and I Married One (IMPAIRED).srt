The Quahog mayoral race is heating up

156
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:54,795
with incumbent Adam West squaring off
against challenger Lois Griffin.

157
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,391
Which leads many political analysts
to ask the question,

158
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,198
can a woman really be mayor?

159
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,398
Or will she just bleed all over the city?
Stay with us.
