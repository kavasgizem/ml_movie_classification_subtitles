1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Ok children I know that today is the last day of school,

2
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and that the last day of school involves pranks, 
but this is going too far!

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now what've you done with Mr.Hat??

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Children, I want Mr.Hat back right now, the prank is over!

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You think I can't get along without Mr.Hat don't you?

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You think I can't live without him. Well I can.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He's just a puppet. I don't need him. See? Watch.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
GOD DAMN IT, WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU PUT MR.HAT!!?!?!

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh no you don't. The school year's over, but summer vacation doesn't start for you

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
little bastards, until Mr.Hat is back on my desk.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now I'm gonna turn around. And when I turn back, 
I expect to see Mr.Hat lying right here.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Ok, I'm gonna turn around now.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Shit! 
Where did everybody go?

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh golly! Kevin honey!

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Good to see you again, son.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Looks like winter's right around the corner.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Better get some firewood ready.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh happy summer gentelemen.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Shut up Pip. 
Right-o. Enjoy summer this summer for me, would you?

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What do you mean?

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You see my parents are dead.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Your parents are dead? God damn you suck Pip.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh yeah it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I've picked up enough money to buy M-80s this year.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nut sack,

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and blow your balls all over your pants!

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Geeze Cartman!

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Well I'm just saying you know don't make my Kitty, you know.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hi fellas. 
Hi Stu.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What can I do for you? 
We wanna buy M-80s.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass. 
Ok that's it.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Screw you guys! I'm going home.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What a baby. 
So we'll have 10 M-80s please.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry fellas, haven't you heard? 
Heard what?

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
All fireworks have been banned in Colorado. 
What do you mean?

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It was in the paper this morning.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Dude just cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, 
we don't get to buy M-80s?

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Right.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How can they do this to us? 
Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah! We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives!

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Udas kill Kenny.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
U bastards.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
A summer without fireworks is like..I don't know, 
but it's like...it sucks ass.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah now what are we supposed to do?

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I can still sell snakes.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is absurd. We need fireworks for our 4th of July celebration at the lake.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't care that some twirp blew his hands off.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We've got to have fireworks for our picknick!

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hold on I've got another call.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hello? No I don't know where Mr.Hat is! Geeze Garrison, I've got bigger problems!

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Hello yes. Now what am I supposed to do about our 4th of July show at the lake?

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No I don't want snakes! This is an outrage!

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Get me the Mayor.....I know that smartass, I was being ironic.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm sorry Mayor but I couldn't find the little man in the boat.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Well keep looking. This is ridiculous.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We can't have a celebration without fireworks.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Who ever heard of a 4th of July picknick with snakes?

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Oh I like snakes. You light em and they grow and grow.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Wait a minute. That's it! I've got it!

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This 4th of July, South Park will make history by having the largest

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
snake in the world!

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The press will love it! 
I'll be on the front pa....ooooh!

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I found him.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Man it's hot out here.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What do you guys wanna do, we have the whole summer to play.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Dude, what are we supposed to do? 
We always just play with fireworks.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I know, let's go sledding. 
Yeah!

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Come on Cartman get on. 
Stan...

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's go dude, we're ready. 
What the hell you waiting for Cartman?

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Guys, don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Whatever.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What the hell's going on?

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hey there boys! 
Hey uncle Jimbo.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
How come you're not blowing things up? It's summer!

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks, because a little boy blew off his hands.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What?!? 
Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh my god! Well don't worry boys. 
Uncle Jimbo is on the case.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Buckle your seat belt Ned.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Mmmwhere are we going? 
Mexico my amigo

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Why are we going to Mexico?

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
To buy fireworks. Just cause some kid blew off his hands,

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer now does it?

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Are fireworks legal in Mexico?

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hell, everything's legal in Mexico. It's the American way.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
At the dynomite firework company, we have a commitment to excellence.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Our focus is on safety while... 
Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now the disk that we're making is aproximately 5000 times

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
bigger than the average snake.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We'll have to fly it in with 3 comanchi helecopters, 
and lower it on to the ground at the lake.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Then we'll need 57 flame throwers all set up around the perimeter of the disk,

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
all triggered to fire at the same time.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Flame throwers triggered at the same time

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Once lit, the snake will.....grow.

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And good times will be had by all.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Wonderful, spectacular!

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well you see, fireworks at the lake will not only go on, 
but perhaps be the best ever.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wait a minute, we're gonna need an orchestra to play the starts and stripes.

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Hey how about the elementary school orchestra.

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
They did a great version of Mary Had a Little Lamb at their last concert.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes get the school principal on the phone. 
And we need somebody to dress up like uncle Raymus.

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Uh Mayor I think you mean uncle Sam.

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh course I do you fucking asshole!

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Dusty the dirtball!

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer.

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Hey look it's Mr.Garrison. 
Hello children. How is your summer going?

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Summer sucks ass Mr.Garrison. 
Hey, have you found Mr.Hat yet?

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Oh, oh that old thing? Why I almost forgot he was gone.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't need Mr.Hat. 
That's good.

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Mr.Hat is just a puppet. 
Yep.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Mr.Hat isn't real. 
Right.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Hey guys, my mom signed me up for swimming 
lessons at the community pool, you wanna come?

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Swimming lessons dude? 
That is the lamest thing I've ever heard.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It is not.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah Cartman, you're swimming around in 1st grader pee!

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm not swimming around in pee! 
Whatever dude.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
My mom says if I take swimming lessons, 
I can be in the Olympics some day.

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah, the fatass Olympics.

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm trying to make the best of a bad situation!

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't need to hear crap, from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial!

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Screw you guys, I'm going home.

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But Cartman we're trying to.... 
Screw you guys....home.

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What does he mean "living in denial"? 
Dude it's Cartman. He's just being a dumbass like always.

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
There how does that look?

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Like a big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Ah crap.

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Ok kids everyone in the pool.

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Come on Eric. We're gonna start now.

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Na-uh. 
Just jump in!

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't wanna. 
It's not gonna hurt you hon. Just do it!

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
There you go!

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Now just let the 1st graders swim by you and then head towards us.

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Huh? First graders!

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Awww weak! Weak! Aww you sons of bitches!

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Where the is our fireworks. We only have 24 hours!

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm sure it'll be here any second. 
Shut up!

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Copy that.

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Ok children, I'm sure we're a little rusty. 
Where is Eric Cartman?

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He's taking swimming lessons.

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Oh dear. How are we supposed to sound good without our french horn section?

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, let's try some scales first. C scale first. And...

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh ok, that was pretty good. 
Let's play Mozart Symphony #5.

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh we're doomed. Our 4th of July celebration is going to have no fireworks

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and a bunch of tonedeaf little shits playing....
wait a minute..it's the snake!

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's move along people, if you see one giant snake

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
thingy firework, you're seen 'em all.

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Call everybody, the show's back on! 
Come one we've only go 1 day to prepare!

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Buenas dias mi amigo.
[Good day my friend]

153
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yo soy uno Americano spectacularr!
[I am a spectacular American!]

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000

[What?]

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yo necessito el fireworko spectacularr! 
[I need the spectacular firework!]

156
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Necessito que usted grande? 
[Do you need that big?]

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
No, moleste el gato spectacular. 
[No, to molest a cat spectacular.]

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Would you look at that Ned. Now that's a Tijuna bottle rocket.

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
These babies have the power to blast a firehole right through the ozone.

160
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
They're spectacular.

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's our job to get these to children all over America for the 4th of July.

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Bueno.
[Good]

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Hello is Mr.Hat there?

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Is this some kind of joke? 
Huh-huh yes!

166
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You go to hell, you go to hell and you die! 
I'm gonna find out who you are!

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Uh, I don't think you can, mmkay.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
God damn it!

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh Lamb Chop. What would you like to do today?

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Well I'd like to sing you a song.

171
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Hey let's sing one together.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
No lamb chop no!

173
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Judy help me! It burns, it burns!

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Eric, you have to get in the deep end sooner or later.

175
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Later's fine. 
Just do your side stroke.

176
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I only know how to do it doggy style.

177
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's doggie paddle Eric. Now come over here.

178
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Can I do it doggy style? 
Ok.

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That's it, that's it you can do it!

180
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh damn it! Ah not again!

181
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Come on Eric! 
No way! These sons of bitches! I'm going home.

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Well 4th of July is finally here, 
and with the state wide ban on fireworks,

183
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
people from all over Colorado 
are flocking to South Park.

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Here with a special report is a 
normal looking guy with a funny name.

185
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Thanks Tom, looks like the firework bad won't be

186
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
putting a damper on one town's festivities tonight.

187
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm here at Stark's Pond in South Park 
where the crowd of residents

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and scores of tourists anctiously await 
the lighting of the largest snake,

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
in human history.

190
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Now as most of you will probably remember,

191
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
snakes are these little round disks 
that you light and they spew out

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
a little snake of black ash.

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Well the South Park snake, 
is over half a mile in diameter,

194
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and 20 stories high.

195
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm told that this even won't begin until 
the sun goes down and night is upon us.

196
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Alrighty then. Looks like we're ready.

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
How are your swimming lessons going Cartman? 
Fine.

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
Well you heard wrong hippy!

199
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado,

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
it's my pleasure to be the first person 
to wish you all a Happy 4th of July!

201
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's start with our school band 
playing the stars and stripes.

202
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This is it.

203
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And a one, and a two, and a ....

204
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What the fuck is that?

205
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I think it's the stars and stripes.

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh hell, light the snake.

207
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Alright Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border.

208
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. 
Just let me do the talking.

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it?

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Good evening gentlemen.

211
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Hello there fellow American.

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We're just anxious to get back to our homeland.

213
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Alright, I just need to ask you a few questions.

214
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Fire away, we have nothing to hide.

215
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Is anyone other than the 2 of you traveling in this vehicle?

216
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
No sir. 
Do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?

217
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah....I mean no.

218
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Open your trunk please sir.

219
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Damn, damn! I always get that question wrong!

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
My god it's beautiful. 
It never fails to amaze me how I managed to overcome adversity.

221
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Say uh Charlie, when does that thing die out?

222
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Die out?

223
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes you know, expire, end.

224
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Hello?!? I'm asking you when it stops!

225
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm not sure, I never made one this big.

226
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I guess we didn't quite think this through did we.

227
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
WHAT!?!?!

228
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Dude, that thing is huge! 
Yeah, maybe they should shut it off.

229
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Ay, you guys are screwing up the song.

230
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Stop it! 
It's out of control!

231
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Kenny watch out!

232
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Hey guys, I dodged the thing, and it missed me...ah!

233
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh my god! They killed Kenny!

234
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You...bastards!

235
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh my god. You tell me how much longer this thing is gonna last!

236
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
let's see. A normal snake lasts 3 sec

237
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So when does it run out??? 
November....of next year.

238
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh hell!

239
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Coming up for 9 hours,

240
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and the giant snake shows no signs of stopping.

241
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Residents have tried everything, from firehoses,

242
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
to yelling at it to make the snake stop.

243
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But nothing seems to work. 
Thanks Creamy.

244
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Police are advising all citizens to stay indoors, 
not breath the ash and air,

245
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and not ever light any giant snakes in the near future.

246
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Man this sucks.

247
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What should we do dude? That big snake keeps growing. 
It's gonna demolish the whole state soon.

248
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.

249
00:14:47,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Where is Chef?

250
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Hello? What? Oh hello children. 
It's a what?

251
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
A giant snake! Killing everybody!

252
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Growing bigger?!?

253
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Children...you know I rarely say this but....well fudge ya.

254
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What'd he say? 
Dude I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.

255
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Wow! 
How's that gonna help?

256
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:57,000
All over America, 
the effects of the giant ash snake can be seen.

257
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yay, let the spirit of heavenly father be blessed upon you.

258
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
From this day on, all will be well.

259
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I already feel like things are getting better.

260
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And I can't sleep or think. 
Where would he have gone, why would he leave?

261
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Well, um let me ask you this. 
Why, where where do you think...Mr.Hat went?

262
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
How the fuck should I know? 
If I knew that I wouldn't be seeing a fucking psychiatrist, would I?

263
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Well I guess, I see what you're saying.

264
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
At first I was sure one of the children took him,

265
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
but then I remembered that Mr.Hat 
and I actually had a fight that morning.

266
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Are you gay?

267
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What? 
It's it's just a question.

268
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Are you propositioning me? 
No.

269
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Well I can tell you that I'm 100% not gay.

270
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Well I believe you. I absolutely believe you.

271
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Mr.Hat on the other hand.

272
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Mr.Hat was gay?

273
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Sometimes he fanatsizes about same sexualations.

274
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I see. 
Sometimes Mr.Hat liked to pretend he was in a sona with Brett Far,

275
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
in a bottle of a Thousand Apple dressing.

276
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That I did not need to know.

277
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Well I'm just saying.

278
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Mr.Garrison, I think that Mr.Hat was 
actually your gay side trying to come out.

279
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You see it's you that's gay, 
but you're in denial,

280
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
so you act out your gay persona with a homosexual puppet.

281
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What do you think about that?

282
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I think you're the loony one in this room.

283
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Serves you right you gay bashing homo!

284
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Well Ned, looks like we missed 4th of July again.

285
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Damn it. Those poor kids must've been 
so disapointed having nothing but them

286
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
stupid woossie snakes to light.

287
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
MMwell better luck next year.

288
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yeah you're right. 
Ok let's try again.

289
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Is anyone other than the 2 of you traveling in this vehicle?

290
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
No.

291
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?

292
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yes?

293
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Damn it, I got it wrong again! 
What's the answer again?

294
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Holy smokes, what the hell is that?

295
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It looks like my ex-wife!

296
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Quick Ned, this is our chance. 
The hummer's outside.

297
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Hey I haven't seen you in here before.

298
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
As more and more cities are effected 
by the growing ash and the death toll rises

299
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
to 3000, people from all over the country 
are looking to the Mayor of South Park for answers.

300
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And it appears as if thought the mayor 
is going to explain matters now.

301
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of South Park 
regrets that she can not be here herself.

302
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But she is sick.

303
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Sick? What kind of lame excuse is that? 
You gotta be kidding me!

304
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Aw this is ridicoulous. 
Come on we want answers!

305
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
She's having her period.

306
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
We do however have an official 
statement for all the concerned citites

307
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
about the matter with the giant snake 
that we can't seem to put out.

308
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:04,000
"We're sorry, our bad." 
Thank you that is all.

309
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Ook. No first graders around.

310
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I can swim to the deep end.

311
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I can do it. I can do it. I can....

312
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm gonna make it.

313
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
How many days left in summer. 
A lot I think.

314
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Damn it! I just want it to snow again!

315
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I don't think it matters dude. 
This giant snake is gonna kill everone soon.

316
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Buenas Gracias boys!
[Good thanks boys]

317
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Hi uncle Jimbo.

318
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Aww now, why the long faces.

319
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
We're bored. There's nothing to do.

320
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Well I don't think that's a problem 
that some Tijuana rockets can't solve.

321
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Hooray!

322
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Careful with those now. Those are dangerous.

323
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Point them away from your eyes now.

324
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Aww look at em Ned. 
Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child.

325
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Hey look! We blew up the snake!

326
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
All the ash from the snake is putting the flame out.

327
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Well how do you like that. 
Bottle rockets saved the 4th of July.

328
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm gonna make it. 
I'm gonna make it to the deep end!

329
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I made it! I made it! 
I made it to the deep end! Hooray for me!

330
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,000
The snake's been destroyed, the pool's open!

331
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh no! You sons of bitches!

332
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Aww sons of bitches!

333
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Look they put out the snake!

334
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yes apparently my plan to blow up 
the snake worked perfectly.

335
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Hey look it's snowing!

336
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Well it's snowing black ash, but what the hell?

337
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Winter's back!

338
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Wow, it's a black blizzard!

339
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Mr.Garrison: Where's Mr.Hat?

340
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Oh I'm through with Mr.Hat. 
He's a two-timing whore.

341
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
From now on children, 
you're all gonna be learning from Mr.Twig.

342
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That's right children. 
I'll see you in the fall!

343
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh I can hardly wait.

344
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Hey children! Everybody! I'm back! 
I'm back from Aruba!

345
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What the....

346
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Hey Chef. 
How's it going?

347
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Howdy Chef, how was your summer vacation?

348
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Ok, everybody get in a line, 
so I can woop all yo asses.
