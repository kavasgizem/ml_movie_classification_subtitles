00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:08,669
D'oh!

00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,871
(tires screeching)

00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:11,539
(grunts)

00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:15,510

9
00:00:28,856 --> 00:00:30,256
Excuse me?

10
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,658
I'm having trouble

11
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:33,426
with the on-off button
on my phone.

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,761
Okay, let me check your
settings, your photos.

13
00:00:35,796 --> 00:00:37,930
I don't see why
you need to do that.

14
00:00:37,964 --> 00:00:39,865
Wow, that guy's
really fat.

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,334
That's my husband! Oh!

16
00:00:42,368 --> 00:00:44,002
Let me talk
to another salesman.

17
00:00:44,037 --> 00:00:45,370
Oh, I'm not a salesman.

18
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:47,339
I'm just a guy
in a blue shirt.

19
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:49,341
Oh!

20
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,208
Okay, Maggie, from now on,

21
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:53,778
we only talk to people at stores
with name tags.

22
00:00:53,813 --> 00:00:57,014
I've said it before,
but this time, I mean it.

23
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:58,917
(tires screech)
(gasps) What happened?

24
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:01,285
Oh, someone snuck into
the construction site,

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,556
stole a bulldozer and went
joyriding all over town.

26
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,528
(cat meows)

27
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:14,731
Don't worry.
I have a suspect. Ha!

28
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:16,767
(gasps)

29
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:19,736
I can't stand
to see anything suffer.

30
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:22,806
Now I've got everything I need
to convict your boy,

31
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:25,575
except for motive,
means and opportunity.

32
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:27,076
You also have
no evidence.

33
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,711
That's implied!

34
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:30,480
So, I'm remanding him...

35
00:01:30,514 --> 00:01:31,914
Is that a word-- "remanding"?

36
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:33,749
Yeah, uh, to your custody.

37
00:01:33,784 --> 00:01:37,219
Maybe a mother can find out
what a police chief can't.

38
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:38,888
(phone chimes)
Hmm?

39
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:40,255
What?

40
00:01:41,824 --> 00:01:43,257
Oh!

41
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:45,226
Let's go.

42
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,963
Monarch butterfly, earwig,

43
00:01:47,997 --> 00:01:50,164
roly-poly, doodlebug,

44
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:53,668
beer cap, ant,
beer bottle, Barney.

45
00:01:53,703 --> 00:01:55,403
All right, I'm on a list!

46
00:01:55,437 --> 00:01:57,438
(dog barking)

47
00:01:57,473 --> 00:02:00,407
(gasps)
Flanders got a new dog!

48
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:02,810
(barking)

49
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,647
Aw, what's her name?

50
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:09,583
Mahershalalhasbaz.
We just call her Baz.

51
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:11,585
Now it's time for her Christian
doggy training.

52
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,086
This will be interesting.

53
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:14,922
Sit. Kneel.

54
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:17,490
Pray. Play dead.

55
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:19,592
Now resurrect.

56
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:22,128
And sit in glory at the
right hand of Todd.

57
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:26,766
Finally, a religion
that makes sense.

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,669
All right, Mr. Smarty,
what went on back there?

59
00:02:29,703 --> 00:02:32,371
Mom, why is it
the only time you call me smart

60
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:33,972
is when you're
being sarcastic?

61
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:35,641
Really? Do I do that?

62
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:37,442
Because I really
shouldn't.

63
00:02:37,476 --> 00:02:40,145
You're the one in
trouble here, bub!

64
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:42,614
Why don't you think
about what you just did?

65
00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:44,482
Why don't you think about
what <i>you</i> just did?

66
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:55,325
Hmm. I will live
with that forever,

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,294
but this is about you.

68
00:02:57,328 --> 00:03:00,464
I swear to you on my mother's
grave, I didn't do a thing!

69
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:02,266
Sorry, sorry.

70
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,704
So, the Flanderses got
a new dog, and it knows my name!

71
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:10,840
Good for you,
little girl!

72
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,241
Marge, Bart, I've noticed

73
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,510
neither of you have said
a word all meal.

74
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:17,313
Are there feelings
going unexpressed here?

75
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:19,482
Because if there are...

76
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:23,152
I believe someone at this table
isn't telling us the truth.

77
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:26,421
Master Bart Simpson!

78
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,361
Kids, could you
excuse us for a moment?

79
00:03:33,396 --> 00:03:36,999
Your mother and I need
to have an adult conversation.

80
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:38,734
What'd he do?
What'd he do? (laughs)

81
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:40,168
Your son stole
a bulldozer.

82
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:42,503
How do you know?
- A mother knows.

83
00:03:42,537 --> 00:03:44,706
Does a wife know things?
- Yes.

84
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,107
(shrieks)

85
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:48,009
I believe
we were talking about Bart.

86
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:50,444
I'm afraid I don't know
how to handle him anymore.

87
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,748
Oh, Bart's ten.
He's too old to be <i>handled.</i>

88
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:57,085
We should just think of excuses
for when he goes bonkers.

89
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:58,551
Oh. "Acne medicine."

90
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:00,420
When in doubt,
blame the acne medicine.

91
00:04:00,454 --> 00:04:02,089
No, I'm not giving
up on Bart,

92
00:04:02,123 --> 00:04:04,190
just like I didn't
give up on our marriage

93
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:07,127
when you quit your job to start
the North American Sumo League.

94
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:09,429
The NASL
would have made money

95
00:04:09,463 --> 00:04:13,399
if <i>someone</i> had washed
a few sumo loincloths for me!

96
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:17,302
I said I would do yours,
but not the whole dojo.

97
00:04:20,107 --> 00:04:23,408
Bart, get in here!

98
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:25,711
Look me in the
eye and tell me

99
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:28,447
you know nothing
about that bulldozer.

100
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,783
I know nothing
about that bulldozer.

101
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:32,450
MARGE:
<i>This is bad.</i>

102
00:04:32,484 --> 00:04:34,418
<i>He can't tell his mother</i>
<i>what he does.</i>

103
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:36,788
<i>Where will that lead?</i>

104
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:38,723
(with Irish accent):
Any last words, boyo?

105
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:40,291
I know nothing
about that bulldozer.

106
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:42,493
Give him the juice!
(electricity crackling)

107
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:43,895
(laughs)

108
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:45,296
Which one's yours?

109
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,065
The one being
electrocuted!

110
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:49,499
I've never seen
an eyeball pop so fast.

111
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:53,436
I wish I could tell you
about that bulldozer,

112
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:56,106
but how can I explain something
I know nothing about?

113
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:58,075
I am not cable news.

114
00:04:58,109 --> 00:04:59,943
Stop it! Stop it!

115
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:01,645
Stop lying right now!

116
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,413
But-but you have
to believe me.

117
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:05,315
You're my mom!

118
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:08,151
All right, I will believe you on this.
Smart.

119
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:11,087
But until then, I'm going
to keep my eye on you.

120
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:12,521
All the time.

121
00:05:12,556 --> 00:05:13,923
All the time?

122
00:05:13,957 --> 00:05:16,358
How are you gonna
change Maggie?

123
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:23,732
Ah, close enough.

124
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:27,502
OTTO:
All aboard.

125
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,604
Mom, what
are you doing?

126
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:32,774
I told you, to trust you,
I have to watch you.

127
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:35,476
All the time.

128
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,880
Mmm.

129
00:05:38,915 --> 00:05:40,547
You're gonna be
riding this bus?

130
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:44,218
I'm going to be watching my son
wherever he goes.

131
00:05:44,252 --> 00:05:45,485
Then you'd better
go out the back,

132
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,754
'cause that's where he went.

133
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:49,289
D'oh!

134
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:53,581
(barking)

135
00:05:55,384 --> 00:05:58,919
Oh, you must be
Flanders' new dog.

136
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:00,755
I just want to
apologize in advance

137
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:02,857
for the things I'm
gonna blame on you.

138
00:06:02,891 --> 00:06:04,258
Homer, meet Baz.

139
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:06,227
(barking)
- (laughing)

140
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:11,398
Oh, sorry, Flanders.

141
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:13,067
I'm sure she has
fun with you.

142
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:15,301
(laughs)
She sure likes you.

143
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:17,470
Must be the cheeseburgers
in your sweat.

144
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:20,439
Cheeseburgers in my sweat.
Really?

145
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:24,577
Now, apparently, I have
<i>cheeseburgers</i> in my sweat.

146
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:30,583
I can leave
any time, Bart.

147
00:06:30,617 --> 00:06:33,252
Just tell me what happened
with that bulldozer.

148
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:35,287
Next question.
- Fine.

149
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:37,289
Which papers
on the walls are yours?

150
00:06:37,323 --> 00:06:39,124
None of them.

151
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:41,393
Is that the boy
who copies off you?

152
00:06:41,427 --> 00:06:43,428
<i>I</i> copy off <i>him?!</i>

153
00:06:43,462 --> 00:06:48,333
What brand of poppycock is this
miscreant feeding you, madam?

154
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,401
Okay, Mom,
I admit it.

155
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:53,070
There's a few lies I told you
that you're gonna find out.

156
00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:54,939
Simpson, you said
your mother was dead.

157
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:56,808
(groans)

158
00:06:56,842 --> 00:06:59,277
She's become
a zombie! Run!

159
00:06:59,311 --> 00:07:01,312
(humming)

160
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,083
Mom, churros are
good for you.

161

They're ethnic.

162
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:10,620
Hey, Simpson,
you need your mommy

163
00:07:10,654 --> 00:07:12,455
to cut your carrots
for you?

164
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:14,324
He can cut his
own carrots.

165
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:16,860
Baby carrots
'cause he's a baby!

166
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,495
(laughter)

167
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,530
Brilliant!

168
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:21,932
Mom, Dad does plenty of stuff

169
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:23,332
you don't like.

170
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:24,834
Why don't you follow him?

171
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:26,268
Following an
adult is creepy.

172
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:28,838
Following your
kid is parenting.

173
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:32,308
I'm so lucky my mom's

174
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:33,843

175
00:07:35,212 --> 00:07:37,112
Is my mom still outside?

176
00:07:37,147 --> 00:07:40,715
She's swinging on a swing,
and Ralph's pushing her.

177
00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:42,717
RALPH:
Hello! Good-bye!

178
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:44,518
Hello!

182
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:53,361
I am never leaving this tube.

183
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:56,064
Sorry, lad. You've been in
more than five minutes,

184
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:57,865
so I've got to remove you.

185
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:01,801
And I'm authorized to use the
greatest weapon at me disposal.

186
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:04,504
(playing "Highland March")

187
00:08:04,538 --> 00:08:06,173
No!

188
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:08,876
Scotland! 1,200 years,

189
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,911

190
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:13,413

Man. (gulps)

193
00:08:17,184 --> 00:08:20,987
Staying on this all-pork-chop
diet is easier than I thought.

194
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:22,588
That diet doesn't work.

195
00:08:22,622 --> 00:08:24,924

196

So, how was
school today?

197
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:28,027
Well, actually,

198
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:30,662
I caused quite a ruckus
in the nurse's office

199
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:32,597
by pointing out they
weren't putting fresh paper

200
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:34,499
on the lay-down table.

201
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,501
Very good, sweetie.
Could you lean back?

202
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:38,236
I have to focus
on your brother.

203
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:40,838
Sure, sure. No need
to worry about Lisa.

204
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:42,240
Lisa's always fine.

205
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:43,608
No worries there. Nah.

206
00:08:43,642 --> 00:08:46,378

00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:49,446

208
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,216
Aw. What are you doing here?

209
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,085
I bet you escaped, and now
Flanders is worried sick.

210
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,621
I should call him...
after I scratch your tummy!

211
00:08:57,655 --> 00:08:59,390
That's right!

212
00:08:59,424 --> 00:09:02,226
Who likes their tummy scratched
while Flanders is worried sick?

213
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,061
You do! You do!
Yes, you do!

214
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:06,930
Oh, he doesn't know
where you are.

215

Come on, boy.
We'll go to my room.

218
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,072

give you a bath, or...

(grunts)
- (groans)

223
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,581
Middle child. No one cares
about the middle child.

224
00:09:26,615 --> 00:09:28,116
Never, ever gonna change.

225
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,918
Lisa, can I talk to you?

226
00:09:29,953 --> 00:09:31,553
Oh, here it is,

just like clockwork.

228
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:37,225
All right, let me speak to you
in a language you'll understand.

229
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,893
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
Lisa never gets it.

230
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:41,228
She's great,
and everyone knows that.

231
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:43,064
Oh, man, trying to stay mad.

232
00:09:43,098 --> 00:09:44,798
I'm kind of impressed
that Dad's making an effort.

233
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,500
It's not really like him.
I shouldn't say this.

234
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:47,835
I should <i>never</i> say this,
but I will.

235
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:49,270
She's my favorite child.

236
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:51,238
Oh, now he's pulling out
the big guns.

237
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:52,773
Oh, I don't want
to pout anymore.

238
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:54,842
If he offers me ice cream,
I'm gonna break.

239
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:56,977
You want some ice cream? (whoops)
- Yes!

240
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:58,878
Ice cream. Oh, yeah, it's kid whiskey.
I knew he was gonna break.

241
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:00,880
I'm gonna write a song.
That makes them happy, and the best part is...

242
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:01,567
Is there such a thing as happy
blues?

243

Bart, you know
you're always welcome

256
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:31,709
to come stay
in my tree house.

257

You don't have a tree house.

My dad's gonna build it.

He's gonna plant it soon.

264
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:46,790
He just has to get
enough money together

265
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:48,791
to buy a pack of apple seeds.

266
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:50,527
Just hand me
the Mountain Doo.

267

00:13:47,395 --> 00:13:49,028
(panting)

322
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:51,331
Sweetie,
let me help you up.

323
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:54,567
Your nagging is
melting my bones.

324
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,235
(whining)

325
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:59,438
(continues whining)

326
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,642
Okay, fine!

327
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,378
I'm giving you
one more chance, buster.

328
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,480
Tell me about
that bulldozer!

329
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,948
What bulldozer?

330
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,849
You're in charge
of yourself.

331
00:14:11,883 --> 00:14:13,484
Get home whenever.

332
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,720
My parenting stops now.

333
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,188
Oh.

334
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,258
Okay, <i>now.</i>

335
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,194
(sighs)

336
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,264
At last!

337
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,365
A way off Lepers Island!

338
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,899
Oh...

339
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:30,934
(gasps)

340
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,344
Boys, I realize now
that Baz would be happier

341
00:14:34,345 --> 00:14:35,813
in another home.

342
00:14:35,847 --> 00:14:39,984
So we're giving her
to Ho... Ho... Ho...

343
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:41,685
We're giving her to Santa?

344
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,120
No! Someone fatter.

345
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:44,321
Oh, I'm sorry, boys,

346
00:14:44,355 --> 00:14:46,322
that you had to hear
that mild insult.

347
00:14:46,356 --> 00:14:48,958
Mild insults are
like mild salsa--

348
00:14:48,993 --> 00:14:50,960
they still burn!

349
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:53,630
(quietly):
Bart, should I shut the door?

350
00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:55,297
No need.
My mom's cool now.

351
00:14:55,332 --> 00:14:57,867
Check it out-- last night,
I stayed up till 10:45.

352
00:14:57,901 --> 00:14:59,702
Oh, my God!

353
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:01,470
BART: I took a picture
so I could show everybody.

354
00:15:01,505 --> 00:15:03,605
Now let me show you
what I've been planning.

355
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:06,474
(à la Mayor Quimby):
Er, uh,

356
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:09,811
welcome to our celebration
of, er, uh,

357
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:12,313
our city's lame-o sign.

358
00:15:12,348 --> 00:15:13,581
You nailed him!

359
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:26,661
"Fie"?
Yeah. Look it up.

360
00:15:26,695 --> 00:15:29,263
"Used to express
disgust or outrage"?

361
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:33,000
(gasps) That's
the worst F-word there is!

362
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:35,036
Bart, I'm not butting in
anymore,

363
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,704
so you don't have to hide things
under your blanky.

364
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:39,505
It isn't a blanky anymore.

365
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,274
Hasn't been for three months!

366
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,276
So, we want you
to have our dog.

367
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,713
You just give her love,
and I'll pay for all the shots.

368
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,715
Shots? What, is she
going to India?

369
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:50,249
Bye, Baz.

370
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:54,720
(barks)

371
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,090
(sniffling)

372
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,093
HOMER:
<i>Aw, geez, I can't stand</i>

373
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,761
<i>to see Flanders sad.</i>

374
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,362
<i>Or happy.</i>

375
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,198
<i>Pretty much can't stand</i>
<i>to see Flanders.</i>

376
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,366
<i>But he'll need something</i>
<i>to cheer him up</i>

377
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,735
<i>when his boys run away.</i>

378
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:11,969
You know what, Flanders?

379
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,537
I think you should
take her back.

380
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,372
Homer, don't be crazy.

381
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,408
Look at that tail
wag for you.

382
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:19,643
Have you seen
what it does for me?

383
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,048
No, no, no.
To her, I'm just another dog.

384
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,218
A dog she's in love with
but can never have.

385
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,485
But she's only got
one of you, Flanders--

386
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,989
the guy who will take
care of her forever.

387
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:34,991
Oh, thank you, Homer.

388
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:37,928
This has been the happiest
dog day afternoon ever.

389
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:39,196
Aw...

390
00:16:44,768 --> 00:16:48,403
I'm still not sure-- did you do
that bulldozer thing before?

391
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:50,606
You were there. Maybe when
I hit you with the blade,

392
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,841
you forgot some stuff.

393
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,175
I was trying to get
your attention,

394
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,610
but it was heavier
than I thought.

395
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:56,946
Well, no one fought more
than Cummings and McLeod

396
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,480
when they invented
the bulldozer.

397
00:16:58,514 --> 00:17:01,483
Even the name "bulldozer"
was a great source of...

398
00:17:01,517 --> 00:17:02,617
Aah!

399
00:17:02,651 --> 00:17:04,619
Bart, I can't do this.

400
00:17:04,653 --> 00:17:08,022
No offense, but I have
a mother who still loves me.

401
00:17:11,994 --> 00:17:14,595
QUIMBY: We come here today
to honor this sign,

402
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,798
which was purchased,
letter by letter,

403
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:19,032
from other failed towns.

404
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,136
Huh?

405
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,436
Aw, stupid Mom.

406
00:17:23,471 --> 00:17:25,605
Stuck something in my backpack.

407
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,641
Typical.

408
00:17:28,843 --> 00:17:32,112
Oh, man, she makes good chicken.

409
00:17:32,147 --> 00:17:35,382
You're the best boy
a mom could want.

410
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,051
I've failed
as a mother!

411
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:45,624
I'm growing a conscience!

412
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:48,027
I've got to change this prank.

413
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,033
Much better.

414
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:56,401
(creaking)

415
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:59,137
Our iconic sign is aquiver!

416
00:17:59,172 --> 00:18:01,673
(nervous chuckle)
Everyone remain calm.

417
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,842
This is a part of the show.

418
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,944
(quietly):
VIP's, follow me.

419
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,880
Much better.

420
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:11,348
I don't seen nothing wrong.

421
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,354
Better to die a VIP

422
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:20,691
than to live as
an ordinary American citizen.

423
00:18:23,862 --> 00:18:26,063
SKINNER:
It says "F-D."

424
00:18:26,097 --> 00:18:28,198
It's a tribute
to the fire department.

425
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,732
(crowd cheers)

426
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:33,069
The chili-cooking saints
of the city!

427
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:35,205
It's true--
we do love our chili.

428
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,106
The secret is stirring it.

429
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:39,742
I'm a huge fan.
That's why I wear suspenders

430
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:41,744
and start little fires
here and there.

431
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:43,379
(panting):
Mom, Mom...

432
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,447
I learned there's a line
I won't cross,

433
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:47,782
and it's 'cause of you
and your chicken.

434
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:50,052
That woman does make
convincing chicken.

435
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:53,355
You're the best boy
a mother could want...

436
00:18:53,389 --> 00:18:56,024
if you tell me about
the bulldozer.

437
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:57,525
All right.
It was me.

438
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,028
(gasps)
Why, you little...

439
00:19:00,063 --> 00:19:01,528
(quiet grunting)

440
00:19:01,563 --> 00:19:03,364
(chuckles)

441
00:19:03,398 --> 00:19:06,734
Yeah, harder to strangle than
it looks, isn't it, Marge?

442
00:19:06,768 --> 00:19:08,135
Oh...

443
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,137
And you're under arrest.

444
00:19:10,172 --> 00:19:12,806
How'd you figure it out?
I heard you say it.

445
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:14,909
The only way
I solve any crime.

446
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:17,178
You don't have
to stop hugging.

447
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:20,781
(coughing)

448
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,545
So you see, Mom,

449
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,213
because of the wrinkled
lay-down paper

450
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,716
in the nurse's office,
I got mono.

451
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,685
You really should've kept
your eyes on that ball.

452
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,886
Oh, all these problems.

453
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,055
You kids are like
whack-a-moles.

454
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,624
Oh, that reminds me.

455
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:38,159
Maggie hurt herself
playing whack-a-mole.

456
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:39,328
Aw.

457
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:50,137
Come here, you.

458
00:19:50,171 --> 00:19:52,640
Come here. I know I've
been having my fun elsewhere,

459
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:55,743
and no one could blame you
if you didn't take me back,

460
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,312
but if you'll have me,
I'll take you

461
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:01,548
on the longest walk
of your life!

462
00:20:01,582 --> 00:20:04,050
No hills.

463
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:07,821
Dogs-- so easy to make up with.

464
