1
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,867
(Marley): Come on, let's go.
Come on, kiddo.

2
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,665
-We're going to have some fun.
-(Cammie): Yeah!

3
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,495
(Marley): You know I'm the best friend
ever. Now get out of here.

4
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,752
-(Renee): Have fun.
-We won't be back till after five, so

5
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,550
-have lots of sex with your husband.
-Marley!

6
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:27,505
Hot, steamy, unbridled sex.

7
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,602
Thank you. You all have fun.
Be good for Marley.

8
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,601
(Marley): We're gonna be good, Mommy.

9
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,853
-No sugar.
-Course not.

10
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,152
-She said no sugar.
-Love you, Mommy.

11
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,276
Take care.
Have fun with her.

12
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,949
Make that magic happen!

13
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,323
-Ready, baby?
-Yes.

14
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,827
-What are we gonna do today?
-Go get some sugar.

15
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,498
What?! Sugar?

16
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:59,954
(voice over Marley): If you think
this is what I want out of life,

17
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:03,962
you know, the whole matrimonial,
maternal fairy tale, you're wrong.

18
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,341
It's not for me and that's okay,
because this idea

19
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:11,549
that you have to fall in love
in order to live happily ever after

20
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,259
is just not true.

21
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,231
(Marley): Stanley...

22
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,809
Stanley...

23
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:26,689
you gotta get up, buddy.
I gotta go to work.

24
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,866
Hey!

25
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,827
Yeah, good morning.

26
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,490

-Wow!
-You need to watch where you're going.

53
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:19,010
Hello. Poster child for not mixing
wine with vodka.

54
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,470
You drank twice as much.
How are you okay?

55
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,555
-Are you okay?
-Ohh h.

56
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,265
Are you? Say yes.

57
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,400
Ohhh!

58
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:40,289
-Glad you could join us. Ready?
-I thought you were doing this.

59
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,583
Okay, why don't we start.
Marley?

60
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,960
-Good morning.
-Morning.

61
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,255
I'm sure this town
has been pitching the hell out of you,

62
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,133
so I won't bother with that.

63
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,802
But I will tell you
that you'll never be number one

64
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,851
as long as your customer base
is 82 percent male.

65
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,681
Yes. Well, women don't buy condoms.

66
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:08,188

Not yours.

67
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,521
Come on, gentlemen.
As I'm sure you're all painfully aware,

68
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:17,155
it is women, myself included,
who dictate when, where,

69
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:21,535
how, with whom and how many times
we're going to have sex.

70
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,958
We can't always count on the man
to have condoms lying around.

71
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:29,664
So we actually do go buy them
and then we end up in the condom aisle

72
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,125
with a choice.
So which brand do we buy?

73
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:37,759
Do we buy Trojan, whose very name
conjures the essence of

74
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,591
penetration with protection?

75
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,850
Or do we choose the one
with the skanky-looking girl,

76
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,396
with big tits,

77
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,396
skimpy shorts
and stripper pumps?

78
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,655
I'll keep this one.

79
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,667
-Hey!
-Yay! Hi, baby.

80
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,962
She had them and their condoms
wrapped around her little finger.

81
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,290
-Alright!
-To the youngest, the hottest

82
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,217
vice president
in the history of advertising.

83
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,260
You should think about
buying a house now.

84
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,434
Yeah, why take the time
to stop and smell the roses?

85
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,685
What you need is a big, fat mortgage
like an albatross around your neck.

86
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:35,814
Okay, in honour of Marley’s
white-trash taste buds we have...

87
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,319
Mac and cheese pizza?

88
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,447
You know what I want
for my birthday? Your metabolism.

89
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,700
I'll trade you my metabolism
for those boobs.

90
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,453
Throw in that necklace
and you've got a deal.

91
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,125
Baby, that's a good trade.

92
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,704
Hey. She's gonna have her own boobs
soon enough.

93
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,755
Way to keep a secret, Marley.

94
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,009
-Are you getting implants?
-No.

95
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,961
-I'm pregnant.
-You're pregnant?

96
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,173
-Cammie's getting a brother.
-Another one.

97
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,553
But we're not ruling out
the implant thing.

98
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,432
-You're disgusting.
-Cheers. To you, Marley.

99
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,807
To us.

100
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,436
-Bye, you guys.
-Good luck out there.

101
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:16,395
-Congratulations on the new boy.
-May he be happy and healthy.

102
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,234
-And may he have a huge penis.
-Geez! You are just terrible.

103
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,570
-Speaking of terrible...
-Speed down.

104
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,247
-Marley made a booty call.
-Shut up.

105
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,745
-I'm serious, baby.
-Bye, good night.

106
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,168
Good night, Doug.

107
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,337
-Love you.
-Love you.

108
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,915
Hey, Doug. Wanna come over?

109
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:41,174
Oh, you're coming over.
No, you are coming over.

110
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,891
(Marley): Oh, my God! Oh!

111
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:48,973
(Marley): Oh!

112
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,897
Mmm, not bad, mister.

113
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,655
Not bad at all.

114
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,203
Oh!

115
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,657
So, does this mean
I actually get to spend the night?

116
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,917
I mean, I love being the first number
on the booty call list, but...

117
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,999
Well, second?

118
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,260
Sure.

119
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,763
What if I want something more?

120
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,059
What if I don't'?

121
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,397
Really?

122
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,896
I thought we made that clear
when we met.

123
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:42,527
That's what people say at first,
so no one gets hurt.

124
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,906
Not me.

125
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,912
Oh! What? Oh, my goodness.
I love you. I love you.

126
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,580
Real.

127
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,588
That's not real. Got it?
-Yes.

128
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,046
Real. Okay?
Not real.

129
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,631
-Fake.
-Fake.

130
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:11,218
Silicon Valley. Got it?
You sure?

131
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,475
Here's a little something
to celebrate your promotion.

132
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,775
Thank you, Mommy.
Such a kind mama.

133
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,990
Okay. Let's see.

134
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:31,072
'Congratulations from your best friends
forever. Renee, Thomas and Cammie.'

135
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,782
Oh, you're so good with words.

136
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,919
Is this the actual gift, or are you
setting me up with him?

137
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:51,224
The idea is: You take him out
and you, um, put a real man in it.

138
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,270
(Marley laughing)
-What? Like maybe Doug.

139
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,940
-Who?
-Ohhh.

140
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,689
Come on.
We all know he wasn't a keeper.

141
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,816
-Poor Doug.
-No poor Doug.

142
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,193
-Ohhh.
-Thank you.

143
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,990
Thank you.

144
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,784
Could you tell him
that Marley Corbett called?

145
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,411
Yeah, that'd be great.
Bye, bye.

146
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,746
Okay, I gotta say something.

147
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,174
I think this Vice Presidency
is making your tits smaller.

148
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,592
Really?

149
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,969
Yeah.

150
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,466
-Really?
-Hm hum.

151
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,548
-Hey.
-Hey, Rob.

152
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:37,020
-Think Marley's tits are shrinking?
-Like, right now?

153
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,019
-No, in general.
-Uh, yeah.

154
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:45,111
-How are we doing on Coffee Land?
-Great. Our favourite so far.

155
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,565
'Drink this dark-flavoured spit
and it'll make you shit.'

156
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,572
-Tell him the others.
-Can't. He has to be across town at 1,

157
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,279
beck here for storyboards at 3
and dinner at 6

158
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,206
and after dinner we have drinks
with the Home Depot.

159
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,831
That's why I love this woman.
I love you.

160
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,378
Jesus. He's running you ragged.

161
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,709
You look-- not so good.

162
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:11,012
-When did you last see a doctor?
-Does Dr Phil count?

163
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,223
Ow!

164
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,273
Shit.

165
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,446

(Marley): Oh.

166
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,571
You look familiar.

167
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,621
-Have we had sex?
-No, um, I'm sorry.

168
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,371
Never mind.
I was just joking.

169
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,502
-Marley, I'm Dr Goldstein.
-You're Dr-- Goldstein?

170
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,299
-Yes, I'm Jewish, from Mexico.
-No. I mean,

171
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,594
I just expected somebody older,
not so--

172
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,139
young.

173
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,842
Take a seat.

174
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,477
-So, Marley...
-Hmm.

175
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:08,528
-What seems to be the problem?
-Not so sure. Hence being here.

176
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:12,483
Look up. So you've been experiencing
some weight loss, right?

177
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,660
-Umm...
-And you had some blood in your stool?

178
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,914
Yes, I've been experiencing

179
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,492
some of that bleeding
you're talking about.

180
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:27,046
Just lie on your back. I'm gonna
feel around your stomach, okay?

181
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,340
-Just relax.
-Okay.

182
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,094
I'm kind of ticklish,
so don't be a wuss.

183
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:41,269
Don't get all feather-fing...

184
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,565
Ow!

185
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,648
Okay, Marley,
we're gonna need to run some tests.

186
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,365
-Up! Time.
-Oh, no, no, no.

187
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,288
-Pens.
-There's still two more seconds left.

188
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,334
-What are you doing?
-Down. Pens down.

189
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,128
Is it weird that
I always find the word 'slut'?

190
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,581
Too bad you only get two points
for 'slut'.

191
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:13,510
Whore gets you three points.

192
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,007

Time.

193
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,840
It's pink juice time.

194
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:28,480
-Think of it like, like bubble gum urine.
-Yummy! Bottoms up.

195
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,814
Mmm. Uh mmm.

196
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,195
Isn't this stuff supposed
to clean you out?

197
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,030
Maybe you didn't do it right.

198
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,326
How can she not do it right?
She drank it.

199
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:53,710
Maybe she drank it too fast,
or, I don't know, too slow.

200
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,465
Ooh! Aw!
Yee-ha-ha.

201
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,675
(Peter): Let us know
when it starts working.

202
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,977

(Marley): Oh, my God!

203
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,773
-Good morning, Marley.
-Oh, really.

204
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,523
Is it? I'm about to get a huge camera
stuck up my butt.

205
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,900
So I don't know
if that qualifies as good.

206
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:19,200
I just need you to sign this document
which states that you understand

207
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,280
all the colonoscopy's risks,
which include heavy bleeding, uh,

208
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,583
infection, perforation, rupture.

209
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,911
On a scale of one to ten,
one being 'never'

210
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,289
and ten being 'happens all the time',

211
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,922
what are the chances of you
rupturing my ass?

212
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,005
Well, not.
The chances are very slim.

213
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:44,059
It's, uh, more procedural.

214
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:48,309
Good, well, procedure away,
my friend.

215
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,856
This is gonna be fun.

216
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,939
Would you mind rolling
onto your left side, please.

217
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,793
Thanks.

218
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,586
Wait a minute.

219
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:19,052
Before we go to whatever base
this is we're going to, um,

220
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,010
shouldn't I know your first name?

221
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,473
Julian.

222
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:31,807
Julian.

223
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,853
Julian Goldstein.

224
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,493
My hero.

225
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,809
Where the hell am I?

226
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,569
-Hello, Marley.
-Oh, my God.

227
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,531
Wait a minute. Oh, my God.
I mean...

228
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,997
-Are you God?
-Not really.

229
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,295
This is just the way
you wanted to see me.

230
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,500
Well, I love Whoopi,
so that's probably why.

231
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,304
Yeah, me too.
Oh, have a seat.

232
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,971
Wow!

233
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:53,062
-I can't believe this.
-Guess what?

234
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,482
-You're dying.
-I am not dying.

235
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,606
I'm just a little stressed,
that's all.

236
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,982
Marley?

237
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:06,026
You're dying,
but I'm gonna give you three wishes.

238
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,076
Then I want to

239
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,081
-fly.
-Okay. Done.

240
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,414
Wait a minute.
This is for real?

241
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:23,343
-I want a million bucks.
-Alright, but I just have to warn you

242
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,637
that that is only gonna be
500,000 after taxes.

243
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,721
-Just 'cause I didn't say 'tax free'?
-Even I don't mess with the IRS.

244
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,268
That sucks.

245
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,815
Third wish?

246
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,028
Okay. Let me think.

247
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,445
-Tic-toc, baby.
-Don't rush me. Jesus.

248
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,698
-Hey, hey.
-Oh.

249
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,279
-Wow.
-I'm sorry.

250
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,285
-You said it, didn't you?
-Yeah, I did.

251
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,786
Wow.

252
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:01,589
I don't know.
I don't know what I want.

253
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,543
You know.
You just don't want to admit it.

254
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,425
But I'm pretty sure
that if you give it some thought,

255
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,552
you'll figure it out.

256
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,222
(God): Marley.

257
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,851
(Julian): Marley.

258
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,353
Marley, wake up.
it's over.

259
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,191
What's over?

260
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,489
Where am I?

261
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,321
Where's Whoopi?

262
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,454
The procedure went fine.

263
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,248
We're going to move you
to the recovery room now.

264
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:41,797
I took some biopsies.
We should get results in a few days.

265
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,464
-it's delicious.
-I agree.

266
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,793
It's crunchy and chewy. Peter,
I'd like to share mine with you.

267
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,799
Here, Pop. I'll go.
(Marley laughing)

268
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:52,223
(Sarah makes choking sounds)
Hey, behave.

269
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,767
Geez, what the hell?

270
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:59,848
Okay. Alright, alright. I forgot
to cook the noodles first.

271
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,729
-Ohhh.
-There's noodles in this?

272
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,527
(Peter): Do not feed this to Stanley.
Take it.

273
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,605
(Renee): No.
I got all this on my plate.

274
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,783
I have cancer.

275
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,155
I went to the doctor last week.
Remember?

276
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:20,163
I said I was fine
and that I was just stressed, but

277
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,711
-I'm not.
-What are you talking about?

278
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,130
I have, um,

279
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,256
colon cancer.
How does one get that, you might ask.

280
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,714
Because I did.
And, um,

281
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,932
-he said...
-We don't know.

282
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,728
Of course you don't.

283
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,937
Everyone is dying of cancer
these days.

284
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,646
Why would you try to figure it out
and put yourself out of a job?

285
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:52,985
I know this is rough, but we need
to talk about what to do next.

286
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:57,493
I'm going to consult with the head
of the oncology department, Dr Sanders.

287
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,621
Can, can, can you just take it out,
so I can go on with my life?

288
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,795
No, unfortunately we can't.

289
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,964
It's already spread
throughout the entire colon,

290
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,713
making surgery impossible
at this point.

291
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,096
And this other guy
would have a better idea?

292
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,593
Dr Sanders, yes.

293
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:20,770
He's one of the best in the country
for-- late stage cancers.

294
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,060
Marley,
at this point you only have two options.

295
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,989
Either you start treatment immediately,
or you'll die.

296
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,285
Ah.

297
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,534
Okay Dr G., I'm gonna give you
a little free advice.

298
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,162
Don't use the 'D' word.
it's a bit of a downer.

299
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,460
And if you're trying
to sell me treatment,

300
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:49,041
I would rethink the 'B' option,
because dying isn't an option.

301
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:52,844
Maybe try something like:
'Try our new and improved chemo,

302
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,637
because the alternative
will leave you breathless!

303
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,343
When your 2:30 walks in here
and you have to tell him that he's dying,

304
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,894
just try it with a little more feeling.

305
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,439

Anyway-- who wants dessert?

306
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,494
Mom? Hi.

307
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,035
Sorry to call so late.

308
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,086
Mom, I'm okay.

309
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,474
I'll make sure that you
get the best possible treatment.

310
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:51,561
-I don't care how much it costs.
-You're going to buy her a new colon?

311
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,317
I will not have
a money discussion.

312
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,739
The gloves are coming off.

313
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,318
Money is the only thing
you can talk about.

314
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,997
Marley needs our love and support.
At least pretend to be here for her.

315
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:06,121
I don't have to pretend.
That's your department.

316
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,297
I'm so glad we got together.

317
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,388
So what did you tell Rob?

318
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,799
-That I have mono.
-Right.

319
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,384
And I'm working from home.

320
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,845
I don't want anybody
from work knowing.

321
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:29,933
I got it.
Your butt is your business.

322
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,602
Huh? Huh?

323
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,438
-My Dad flew out this morning.
-Is your Mom happy?

324
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,694
So much so she's celebrating
by moving here.

325
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:42,153

-What?

336
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,946
-Quick, Marley.
-(DJ): Code 9797.

337
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,991
-Go on! 9797.
-I got it.

-Hello? Who's this?
-Marley Corbett. Did I win?

-You're caller 97! Congratulations.
-Oh, my God.

-You've just won!

342
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:39,218
You won a free day of hang gliding

344
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,819
-Hey, how you doing?
-Not too good.

345
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,278
Yo, J. G.

346
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,160
-Hi.
-How's it hanging?

347
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,785
Um-- good.

348
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,040
You here
to work on your bedside manner?

349
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,874
-No. Checking on some test results.
-Ah. Of course.

350
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:21,052
-Are you on your own?
-Why? Want to keep me company?

351
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,719
Yeah.

352
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:32,472
-How do you feel?
-To be honest, I could use a good laugh.

353
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:36,104
-Want me to tell you a joke?
-I'd prefer someone funny.

354
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,110
Alright. What? Go.

355
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:46,201
Okay, um, there's this guy that...

356
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:49,155
No-- It doesn't work.

357
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,117
It doesn't work,
because you just put me on the spot.

358
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,418
Did you hear about the medical student

359
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,542
who interrupted the proctologist
during a lecture?

360
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,591
He said: "Excuse me, sir, um,

361
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:04,261
uh-- is that a rectal thermometer
behind your ear?"

362
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:09,388
The proctologist touched behind his ear
and said: "Oh, shit!

363
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,265
Some asshole stole my pen."

364
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,899
You can use that one.
I've got so many more.

365
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:22,522
-You know, it's okay to feel nervous.
-I'm not.

366
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,857
Not really.

367
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,318
-I just..
-(Nurse): Marley Corbett?

368
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,003
-Wish me luck.
-You don't need it.

369
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,297
-You'll do great.
-Yes!

370
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,843
What are you doing here?

371
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,304

Just getting caught up.

372
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,014
It's Saturday. Go home.

373
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,982
-You look like shit.
-Mono's only moderately contagious.

374
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,814
-it's so nice not having you around.
-Yeah.

375
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,491
By the way:
I licked all the water bottles.

376
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,739
Good afternoon.

377
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:19,579
-Ummm.
-Hey! Oooh.

378
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,461
You. Hi. Wow.

379
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,170
Yeah, my belly button is in
a different zip code than the rest of me.

380
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,879
It just pops.

381
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,590
-How was the appointment?
-Oh, good.

382
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:36,053
My doctor says that
everything is good. Thank God.

383
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,896
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

384
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:45,900
'Cause I bet my doctor
is way cuter than your doctor.

385
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:50,530
Marley! Please tell me
you're not flirting with your doctor.

386
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,704
-So what if I am?
-Never mind.

387
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,907
-Say what you're gonna say.
-No, I...

388
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,285
Why do I feel like I'm more concerned
about this than you are?

389
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:04,420
Shouldn't you focus on getting cured
rather than getting laid?

390
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,592
Can't I do both?

391
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:11,047
Could you just for once
not treat everything like it was a joke?

392
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:29,114
Hey, sleepy monster,
do you want to go for a walk?

393
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,987
You need to go for a walk.

00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:40,705
Fine.

It's good. I like it.

411
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,989
Plus, I learned from those ladies
over there,

412
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,289
what do you call a jazz musician
without a girlfriend?

413
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:46,244
-Here we go. What?
-He doesn't have a home.

414
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,668
It's 'homeless'.

But 'A' for effort.

-He's been performing since he was 8.

00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,651
-Wow!
-So, what are you doing now?

418
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,445
Want to get
something to eat with me?

419
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,527
-Like, gefilte fish tacos, perhaps.
-No, I can't stay. I'd love to,

420
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:23,659
but it's not doctor protocol
to hang around with a patient.

421
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,162
Well, I won't say anything
if you don't.

422
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,959
I'm really fun.

423
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,925
How can I say no to that, right?

424
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:46,224
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

425
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:49,227
-No.
-Why do you not have a girlfriend?

426
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,696
-Is it that obvious?
-Oh, yeah. Yup.

427
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,867
-I practically live at the hospital.
-Not much of a life.

428
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,694
Actually, Dr Sanders
called me to work here

429
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:07,284
out of more than 2000 applicants.
I can't sacrifice that for a personal life.

430
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,368
Uh-uh.

431
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:13,422
I guess I'm more of a
cake-and-eat-it-too kind of girl.

432
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:14,589
-Oh, yeah?
-Hm.

433
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,133
Then why aren't you
in a relationship?

434
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:20,554
Because I don't need to be in one
to have a personal life.

435
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,678
-You're not answering the question.
-Well,

436
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:27,933
read about it in my next book:
'Why relationships suck ass!

437
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:31,641
You know, I've never met anyone
that talks so much

438
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,351
and says nothing at the same time.

439
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,897
Okay. Fine.

440
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:41,325
That was so...

441
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,832
This is me.

442
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:56,499
And-- that's me over there.

443
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,718
Good night, Dr G.

444
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,384
Good night.

445
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,934
I'm making you
a nice, big, juicy steak.

446
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:19,021
Ma! I've been a vegetarian
for 12 years.

447
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:22,108
Well, you need some protein.

448
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,493
Mm-hmm.

449
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,031
By the way, your father called again.

450
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:34,127
 He said he was going to do
his best to make it out here.

451
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,547
Blah, blah, blah.

452
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:41,092
I don't know why you didn't have
your friend Sarah watch the dog.

453
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,091
Then I could stay here with you.

454
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,049
Strike one.
Wanna try for two?

455
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,930
Well, I can't control my allergies.

456
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,057
Or her complaining.

457
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,104

I heard that.

458
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,978
I just wanna help.
Tell me what to do.

459
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,108
Mom, you're here. That's enough.

460
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,611
Would you go to a nutritionist
if I could arrange it?

461
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,613
-Mom!
-Everybody,

462
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:09,913
-swears by this macrobiotic diet.
-I don't want that heely-feely shit.

463
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,990
So just back off.

464
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,459
Oh, this steak is burning.

465
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,630
Go rub some dander on her.

466
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,632
Go.

467
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:31,977
Shoo! Shoo! Call him, Marley.
Call him. That's not funny.

468
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,057
Hi, Dr Sanders. Marley.

469
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,566
Have a seat.

470
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:44,357
-Is anyone joining you? Mother?
-Trust me,

471
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,487
neither of us wants her here.

472
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,533
-Hi.
-Uh-oh.

473
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,411
Two against one.
This can't be good.

474
00:33:55,075 --> 00:34:00,377
Marley, I'm sorry I have to say this,
but there's been no improvement.

475
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,549
-Wait. What are you saying?

476
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,754
The chemo hasn't worked
as we had hoped.

477
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:11,262
And the tumours
have continued to grow.

478
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,764
What now?
What...

479
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:18,223
There is one particular clinical trial
that's had some success.

480
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:23,028
Although, typically with patients
who had better result from chemo.

481
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:26,482
Success like people cured?

482
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,988
-Yeah.
-What is it?

483
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,163
It's a series of treatments,
two times a week.

484
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,240
It's injected into the affected areas.

485
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:40,250
The objective is to stop or slow down
the growth of the cancerous cells.

486
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,420
It's an option.

487
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,751
But you need to be aware that
the side effects are very extreme.

488
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,007
There are no guarantees.

489
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,595
Of course.

490
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,928
We have to do it.

491
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,442
So you're going to be a guinea pig?

492
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,487
It's not an experiment.
It's a clinical trial.

493
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:08,691
What do you know about this trial?
What are the success rates?

494
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,276
-He said they're pretty good.
-Pretty good?

495
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,909
And that's it? You're going
to do it just off of that?

496
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:18,868
Actually no, I flipped a coin.
Heads do it. Tails drop dead.

497
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,920
Look, I'm just saying
that we need to make sure this is

498
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:25,215
-the appropriate course of action.
-Excuse me. We?

499
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,758
As in you, Mom and me?

500
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,837
When have you ever been around
to make any important decision?

501
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:34,015
You know what? I'm not going to have
this conversation with you. I...

502
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,910
Will she be able to go home today?

503
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,579
Depends on how she responds
to the treatment.

504
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,701
Ow!

505
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,628
Can I be here
while you do the procedure?

506
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,829
No.

507
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,707
I'm sorry, you cannot.

508
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,641
What if I'm very, very quiet?

509
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:24,858
Sorry, but the concept of my mother
being quiet is incredibly funny.

510
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,690
It is.

511
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:35,198
-(Marley): Am I gonna lose my hair?
-(Doctor): No, your hair will be fine.

512
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:40,202
-(Marley): Ow!
-(Doctor): I'm sorry.

513
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:56,598
"Roses are red, violets are blue,

514
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,344
I've got ass cancer,

515
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,932
now you know too."

516
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,484
Don't you feel guilty for
leaving me all those nasty messages

517
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,483
for missing work?

518
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,064
Yeah, but I'm...

519
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:17,577
You should have come to me sooner.
Why did you keep it a secret?

520
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:21,282
Because I didn't want you
to look at me the way you are now.

521
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:32,001
So, have you filed
with the insurance company?

522
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,711
Well, I'm not footing the bill
out of my salary.

523
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,762
No, I mean life insurance.

524
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:41,139
Look, people recover from cancer
and, um,

525
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:45,017
however much money you need
to make that happen, I want you to have.

526
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:49,977
There's an option in the company policy
that says that anybody who has a

527
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,398
life-threatening illness

528
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,360
-can cash out.
-Meaning how much?

529
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,573
A million dollars.

530
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:03,282
Let me guess. That would be
500,000 dollars after taxes.

531
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,168
I think my God will be Gucci.

532
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,593
-Yeah, definitely.
-I think so.

533
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,880
-Oh, I love it.
-You can fight me for it.

534
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,807
I've got a big G for gorgeous.

535
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,682
Cammie goes to college,
or Mommy gets this bag.

536
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,601
(Sarah): Love you.

537
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,395
(Peter): Okay.

538
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,647
They're fabulous!

539
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,533
I want you to have these.

540
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,702
Am I making you hot?

541
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:50,207
What kind of cologne is that?
He was flirting with me.

542
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,664
-(Marley): Oh, boy.
-(Sarah): You're so weird.

543
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,876
Hey-

544
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:01,344
There's a maternity department upstairs.
Want to check that out?

545
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:06,679
You know-- I'm really tired.
I'm gonna go home and lie down.

546
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,265
Um, thank you so much for today.

547
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,101
-I'll call you later. I love you.
-I love you too.

548
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,821
(Sarah): I like that.

549
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,824
(Peter): Looks like something
a stripper would wear.

550
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:28,875
-Is everything okay?
-No. it's not okay.

551
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,499
-She's really sick.
-I know.

552
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:35,833
I'm trying so hard to play along,
but I'm terrible at it.

553
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:40,136
And l-- I just don't want
to ruin her day.

554
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,885
That's the last thing I want to do,
so-- bye.

555
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,637
I'll take her home.

556
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:58,151
-NO!
-It would look so nice on you.

557
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:02,826
-Yes, it would. If I was you.
-A simple 'no' would have sufficed.

558
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,450
I don't need no clothes.
This is for you guys.

559
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,748
Everything you own
is swimming on you.

560
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:13,374
-The swimming look is in.
-I just want my daughter to look good.

561
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,797
When you look good, you feel good.

562
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,342
I don't need a new wardrobe
to feel good.

563
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,216
You also don't need
a negative attitude.

564
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,549
You need to wake up and realize
I'm not getting any better.

565
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,010
-Can we not do this here.
-No. Seriously!

566
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,312
You always bitch about
how Dad can't confront anything

567
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,389
and here you are
walking around in a haze,

568
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:37,194
like protein and a designer dress
are going to cure my cancer.

569
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,278
Ahhhh!

570
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:50,373
This is the car. This one.
Thank you.

571
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:54,203
-Was it really that bad?
-I heard you from Jimmy Choo.

572
00:40:55,495 --> 00:41:00,342
-it's just that she drives me crazy.
-Well, duh! She's your Mom.

573
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,043
That's her job.

574
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,805
-Thanks for everything.
-Thank you.

575
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,555
Ah. OW. Ah.

576
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,936
Marley.

577
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,724
Hey. it's okay.

578
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,606
Just give me a second.

579
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,152
It's gonna be okay.

580
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,415
-Is she gonna be alright?
-She's dehydrated.

581
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,118
A couple of bags of saline
and she'll be feeling better.

582
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,703
She is right here, people.

583
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,209
'Shop till you drop'
is only an expression.

584
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,915
Not bad.

585
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,627
That's the best thing
I could come up with.

586
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,303
Dr G.

587
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:47,676
-Ah, hi.
-Hi. Hello.

588
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,975
GI extra ordinaire.
Artist extra ordinaire.

589
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,144
-Pleased to meet you.
-Nice to-- oh!

590
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,266
I...

591
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,855
I'm suddenly in the mood for some Jell-O.
Do you need anything?

592
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,651
Really? Jell-O?

593
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,152
-I'm good. Thanks.
-Okay.

594
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:11,617
Strangely, she's not so good
with needles. Ouch!

595
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,496
-So what happened?
-I don't know. I just had a

596
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:19,125
-sudden, searing pain.
-Hm.

597
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,046
Come on, doc. Level with me.

598
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,091
Is all this really
gonna be worth it?

599
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,920
Yeah, um-- well just

600
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,973
-tell me where exactly...
-OW!

601
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,220
Sorry.

602
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:37,056
Well, there was a pain in my ass,
but then I realized it was my mother.

603
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:40,187
Marley, come on.
Just answer the question.

604
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:44,237
Is there a woman with a very big needle
standing next to me?

605
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:49,276
Ow! That's my skin
you're pricking.

606
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,611
I'm sorry. I can't seem
to find a vein.

607
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,162
Let me try.

608
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:08,211
Dr G?

609
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,798
I think I found one.

610
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,065
I don't know how it's doing
against my cancer,

611
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,440
but this treatment
sure is kicking my ass.

612
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,521
Two down, eight to go.

613
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,323
Hey, Marley. Hey. Marley.

614
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,821
-Hi.
-Hi.

615
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:34,495
Hey, Marley.

616
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:40,168
There's, um, there's a fund raiser
on Saturday" for patients.

617
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:43,998
-Oh, nice.
-Yes, it's for patients, and...

618
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,961
Sorry. I'm just going to walk over there
where I can still eavesdrop.

619
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,597
I wanted to see
if you wanted to come with me.

620
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:56,552
Not come with me as a date,
or anything like that. No.

621
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,605
It's semi-formal, so I don't know
if you like the idea of getting dressed.

622
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,399
I can't tell if you're trying
to talk me into it,

623
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:07,024
-or talk yourself out of it.
-A bit of both.

624
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:12,280
-I'll see how I feel Saturday.
-Oh, good. Okay. Thank you.

625
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,827
-Sorry. Thank you. Bye.
-Bye.

626
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:22,744
Where, besides your life and General
Hospital, do doctors look like that?

627
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,751
I mean-- come on!

628
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:30,260
Hello, Marley. It's your father.

629
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,759
First of all, I don't appreciate
you hanging...

630
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:44,732
Stanley meta really cute Shitszu today.
I think he had a crush.

631
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:49,855
I'm not saying you should,
but if you let him mate,

632
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,110
you'd probably start
a whole new breed:

633
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:54,822
BullShits.

634
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,037
BullShit Terriers.

635
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,087
Okay.

636
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,502
Someone needs comfort food.

637
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:18,596
I'm gonna go home and fix you
a really nice Italian dish.

638
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:22,262
So later on when your doorbell rings,

639
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,270
you answer it. Okay?

640
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,892
Okay.

641
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,107
Beautiful.

642
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,532
You Marley?

643
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,583
-Yeah.
-I'm Vinnie.

644
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,871
These are for you.

645
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,416
Thank you. l-- whoa, whoa.

646
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,927
-I love you.
-Bastard.

647
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,607
Ah.

648
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,286
How do you know Peter?

649
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,871
Who?

650
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,495
I got a call from work
to be here tonight.

651
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,165
Especial Escorts.

652
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,509
I'm really sorry.

653
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:29,439
Well, you should know
that I definitely live up to my nickname:

654
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,607
Little Bit of Heaven.

655
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,982
Oh!

656
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:39,148
That is some offer, but, um,

657
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,992
no.

658
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:54,839
-Oh, don't forget your flowers.
-Nah, you keep them.

659
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:58,214
Beautiful flowers
for a beautiful lady.

660
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,464
Thank you.

661
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:04,674
Actually, I don't mean to sound rude,
but-- you don't look so good.

662
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:09,812
I'm sick.
Probably dying.

663
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,310
There isn't anything to be afraid of.

664
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,065
I've died twice
and they brought me back both times.

665
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,192
Really?
Did you see anything,

666
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:22,901
like bright lights or anything?
Whoopi?

667
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,860
No.

668
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:28,164
It Was, uh,
more like floating in water.

669
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:30,787
It was real nice.

670
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,290
I could have floated there forever.

671
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:37,631
Nice to meet you, Marley.

672
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,501
Nice to meet you.

673
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,140
Vinnie!

674
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,929
Alright, I'm going all in.
You know why?

675
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,856
Because I got the nuts.

676
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:58,106
So you should probably fold,
or...

677
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,028
What are you doing?

678
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,027
Or I'm bluffing.

679
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,038
Fold.

680
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:13,209
-Ohhh!
-Ohhh! Woo!

681
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,127
-Okay. See?
-Oh, boy.

682
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,001
-Smart.
-Full house, baby.

683
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,886
-Are you really single?
-I'm the cancer chick, remember?

684
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:27,636
Hardly qualifies me for being
somebody's dream girl.

685
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:32,221
Why? Most of the great romances
in history end in death.

686
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:36,183
Romeo and Juliet.
JFK and Jackie.

687
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,643
-Siegfried and Roy.
-Um,

688
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,562
Roy is not dead.

689
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:45,320
Well, he didn't look too good.

690
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,369
-I haven't found the right guy yet.
-Bullshit.

691
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,743
Who wouldn't want a girl like you?

692
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,245
You are just afraid to let them in,

693
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:58,000
because if you do and they reject you,
it hurts worse than death.

694
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,581

You're like

695
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,214
-Sigmund Freud all of a sudden?
-(German) Ja.

696
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:09,758
Actually, a guy I like asked me out
this weekend. Sort of.

697
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,558
He said it wasn't a date.

698
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,432
-What time does it start?
-Five.

699
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,013
-Dinner and a movie?
-Fund raiser.

700
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,517
-Formal?
-Semi.

701
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,565
-He's an idiot.
-I know. Right?

702
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:23,438
Well, maybe he'll wise up
and treat it like a real date.

703
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:24,989
If not, fuck him.

704
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,408
Would you mind doing me a favour?

705
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,327
(Marley): Oh, I like that.

706
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,628
(Vinnie): Yeah, a little bit of heaven?

707
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,250
-You want more heaven?
-Oh.

708
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:45,051
You want a whole lot of heaven?
Oh!

709
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,880
-(Marley): Ooh! Oh, my God, baby.
-Oh, my!

710
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:52,388
Oh, my. Oh, my God.
Ohhh!

711
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,935
Ohhh! Ohhh!

712
00:50:56,929 --> 00:51:00,650
(Vinnie): Ohhh!
Oh, that feels good.

713
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,601
(Marley): Oh, oh.

714
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,983
(Vinnie): OW, the bottle. Ow, ow.

715
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,690
-Oh.
-Woo!

716
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:11,744
-Wow! Oh, my.
-Woo.

717
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,947
WOW, Vinnie.

718
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,781
-Oh.
-Marley.

719
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,494
-Thank you, Vinnie.
-You're welcome.

720
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,545
I had so much fun.

721
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:28,962
See what happens
when you give a guy half a chance.

722
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:38,767
You might be sore in the morning.

723
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:41,565
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

724
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,144
See ya.

725
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:19,103
-Is there a doctor in the house?
-Que guapa que estás.

726
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:23,775
No clue what you just said,
but it sounds so good I don't care.

727
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,068
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

728
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:29,022
-No, for coming.
-I know.

729
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:32,529
-Would you like to have a drink?
-Yeah.

730
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,653
Okay. There.

731
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:42,414
-I have a good one.
-Could you be more specific?

732
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:46,669
-A joke.
-Oh, God, I created a monster.

733
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:49,170
-You wanna listen to it?
-Yes, of course.

734
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:54,756
Okay, um, okay.
Why does it suck being an egg?

735
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:59,185
-I give up.
-Why does it suck being an egg?

736
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:03,139
Because you only get laid once,
you only get eaten once,

737
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:06,852
you take 10 minutes to get hard
and only 3 to get soft.

738
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:10,689
And then you have to share this box
with 11 other guys.

739
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:13,194
But the-- worst thing is...

740
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,489
Oh, it's the funny part.

741
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,037
(Marley laughing)

742
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,787
You are the worst joke teller
I've ever met.

743
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,084
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that

744
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,413
the only person to ever
sit in your face is your mother.

745
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,214
You're just hopeless.

746
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,839
-Ms Corbett.
-Hi, Dr Sanders.

747
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,560
I'll grab an appetizer.

748
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,976
-She's a brave girl.
-Yeah.

749
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,316
You know she quit the trial.

750
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:58,240
NO, l-- I didn't know that.

751
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:04,788
It seems to me that your patient's
having an easier time

752
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:08,121
keeping emotion out of this decision
then you are.

753
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:13,175
I'm just trying to save her life.
What else am I supposed to do?

754
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,423
Why did you invite her here?

755
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:20,053
Because there's patients, survivors.
it's a fund raiser for cancer.

756
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:23,887
The line is there for a reason, Doctor.
Not just for the patients.

757
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,643
You'll need to think about
what you're doing.

758
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,566
-Hey, can I?
-Yes, sir.

759
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,737
Thank you.

760
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:40,236
What did I miss?

761
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:46,625
-Do you wanna get out of here?
-Yeah, I know just the place.

762
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,750
First dinner, then a surprise.

763
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,085
Let's go.

764
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:00,305
What-- a surprise in a dark alley?

765
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:04,760
-Do you really know where we're going?
-Yeah, I do.

766
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,392
Where are you taking me?
Come on.

767
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,974
In all the years you've been here,

768
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:13,652
you've never been
to a little place called Paradise.

769
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,236
Hey, hey.

770
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:24,789
Hey, Marley. Hey.

771
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:28,959
-Hey. Wow.
-Don't worry, they don't bite

772
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:32,789
much.

773
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:49,225
Isn't this fun?

774
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,978
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Are you new in town?

775
00:55:58,689 --> 00:55:59,736
Hey-

776
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:06,948
Marley.

777
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,327
Hey-

778
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:24,966
Hey, no, wait.

779
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,800
No, wait, wait, wait.

780
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,566
You look amazing.

781
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,162
(Marley and Julian laughing)

782
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,915
You're such a tranny magnet.

783
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:58,044
If I wasn't there, you could have
for sure gotten some action.

784
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:02,344
I know.
Actually, you know that Adam?

785
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,593
She was kind of hot, no?
Yeah.

786
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,430
Ahhh.

787
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,602
Where did you go?

788
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,444
Do you believe in God?

789
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,819
-Wow.
-No, really.

790
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:28,325
Okay, if you ask me, Dr Julian Goldstein,
if I believe in God...

791
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:32,783
I mean, I believe in science
and in empirical evidence, so,

792
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:36,541
no, I don't believe in a higher power.

793
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:42,423
But if you ask me, Julian,
I'd say I don't know.

794
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:45,846
Why?

795
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:50,051
I envy people who do.

796
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,308
They're so sure
that something exists.

797
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:57,187
What a great way to live.

798
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,981
Without fear.

799
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:04,781
What are you afraid of?

800
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:10,950
-No.
-Come on. Come on.

801
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,949
I want to know.

802
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:18,457
-The whole list?
-How about the top three?

803
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:20,039
Fine.

804
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:23,126
I'm afraid if I die
my Mom will never recover.

805
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,382
Okay.

806
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:30,341
I worry about who'd take care
of my dog.

807
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,138
Anything else?

808
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:40,146
I'm scared this entire night
is gonna go by without you kissing me.

809
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,154
Ah.

810
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,583
So this is a date, right?

811
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:53,007
Yeah-- It's just that I--
they don't wanna...

812
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,013
I quit the trial.

813
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:02,307
I know.

814
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:07,071
-Why?
-I want to enjoy quality of life.

815
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:12,326
Besides, and you're gonna think
I'm crazy, but Whoopi Goldberg...

816
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,779
She is a lady who knows
what she's talking about.

817
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:20,454
(Marley laughing)

818
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:23,413
-You don't.
-Right.

819
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:26,339
Coming from a guy
with a yo-yo collection.

820
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:29,213
What?
You don't like yo-yos?

821
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,636
You have a problem
against yo-yos?

822
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:34,093
Well, let me show you.

823
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:37,930
Okay.

824
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,724
You really are the biggest dork
I've ever slept with.

825
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:46,026
That's a very nice thing of you to say,

826
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:50,322
but it's afar better compliment
if you leave dork out of that sentence.

827
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:55,278
You are the biggest
I have ever slept with.

828
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:02,622
What a trick!
What a trick!

829
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,716
Yeah, yeah, I know, but I...

01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:39,423
-Hey, do not look over.
-Okay.

845
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:42,476
Do you see those two guys
talking to Julian?

846
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,598
Okay, look now.

847
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:48,599
Stop. Stop looking.

848
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:52,277
I'm having drinks
with Clark Kent tonight.

849
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:55,276
And dinner with Superman tomorrow.

850
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:59,861
Oh boy, you have taken my whore crown
and are wearing it so well.

851
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:03,197
It's a little big.
I've been wearing it as a belt.

852
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,203
Ahh!

853
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:12,623
You know, actually, Renee's life
is looking pretty good to me lately.

854
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:19,762
Marley, I...

855
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:25,932
I'm sorry, Marley, I don't know.
I just-- I'm sorry.

856
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,638
Sssh. It's okay.

857
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:19,777
Oh, that's sweet, isn't it?

858
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,575
Let's put it right in here
with your name on it.

859
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:27,118
What do you think Martha Stewart
would think of my arrangement, Stanley?

860
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,540
Okay.

861
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:33,746
Maybe I could quit planning parties
and do my own flower arrangements.

862
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:38,546
You're home early.

863
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:41,799
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah, it's fine.

864
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,391
-Did something happen?
-I'm going back to bed.

865
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,844
Did you and Julian have a fight?

866
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,313
No.

867
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:55,893
Do you want to talk about it?
Maybe I could help.

868
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:59,229
Right. 'Cause you're the expert
in relationships.

869
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:12,159
Mom, please, not now.

870
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:15,337
I may have made a mistake
marrying your father.

871
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:19,258
May have?
The man is emotionally constipated.

872
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:22,176
I'm grateful he gave me you.

873
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,159
Oh, my goodness.

874
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,446
Can I have a big hug?
Oh.

875
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,035
Mmm.

876
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:57,621
-Hey.
-Did she tell you?

877
01:05:57,704 --> 01:05:59,957
God, my mother is a walking mouth.

878
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:03,760
-A walking mouth.
-Hello, Cammie.

879
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:06,759
-You look very pretty today.
-What do you tell him?

880
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:11,514
-And I'm smart.
-Good girl. Good girl.

881
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:13,095

Oooh!

882
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:18,688
Oh grody, he's peeing!

883
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,697
So what was this morning about?

884
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:28,235
-I don't know. I couldn't sleep.
-I know.

885
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:32,539
-But why?
-Well, a reminder: I'm dying.

886
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:38,541
Yeah okay, and I haven't helped you,
um,

887
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,339
get in touch with all the--
the anger and...

888
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:42,916
You know what? Just stop.

889
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:46,549
I'm so not in the mood
for a lecture right now.

890
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:50,178
Hey! It's obvious that you're scared.
it's normal. it's fine.

891
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:53,931
Is it normal for doctors
to screw their patients?

892
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,765
We had a good time.
Let's just leave it at that.

893
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,690
Wow!

894
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:03,066
-Whoa, already past tense.
-Well,

895
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:08,199
reality check: It's going to be
past tense soon enough.

896
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:13,155
-Hey, Marley...
-Mmm.

897
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,954
I love you.

898
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,959
Oh, great.

899
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:29,462
Fantastic.

900
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:32,807
You love me.

901
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:38,059
What kind of guy
falls in love with a dying girl?

902
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:41,311
Don't diminish what's going on
between us. Okay?

903
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,485
-I know what I'm feeling.
-I do too.

904
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,564
I feel smothered
and I need you to back off!

905
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:47,693
No, no...

906
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:50,992
-Ow!
-Are you okay?

907
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,820
Leave me alone!

908
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:59,330
-Come on, let me help you.
-I said: Leave me the hell alone!

909
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:05,252
-I'm sorry, sweetie.
-I wanna go home.

910
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,925
I know.
I'm gonna take you home right now.

911
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:10,845
I'm sorry.

912
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:17,886
Let me see.
Let me see that beautiful face.

913
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,603
-Let me see...
-(Renee): Hey, you're back early.

914
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:27,945
-Hi, Mommy.
-Hi, pumpkin. Did you all have fun?

915
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:29,898
-You're having a party.
-No.

916
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:34,737
Some of the other moms dropped by.
Sort of an impromptu thing.

917
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,787
It's not contagious, you know.

918
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:39,244
Of course not.

919
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:44,754
Um-- why don't you go back
and play for a little bit.

920
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:48,584
-Bye, sweetie, I love you.
-Bye.

921
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:52,296
I've just been really busy, you know.
With the baby coming and...

922
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:56,383
Oh, really? You obviously have time
for those women in there.

923
01:08:56,466 --> 01:09:02,690
-That's different. They're...
-What? They're fat, boring and

924
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:07,310
-not dying?
-Okay.

925
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,612
Want me to make this
more palatable for you?

926
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:11,564
-That's not what I want
-Are you just

927
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:15,027
angry because you're going
to have to find a new babysitter?

928
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:18,788
Yeah.

929
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:23,789
Come on.
That's exactly what I'm angry about.

930
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,845
(Peter): They could fire you
on the first day.

931
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:39,676
(Matt): Oh, yeah?

932
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:46,062
-Hey, the zoo, how was it?
-Oh, you know. It was fantastic.

933
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:51,613
Um, Marley, this is Matt. My friend
who moved here from Brooklyn.

934
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:54,737
Nice to meet you.
Peter's told me a lot about you.

935
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,238
Really?

936
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:59,571
-Did he tell you I was dying?
-Yeah.

937
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:02,783
A couple more weeks
and I'm out of here.

938
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,243
Why don't you take a look
at my apartment.

939
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:08,751
Then maybe you guys
can be neighbours and love buddies.

940
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:11,879
Excuse me.
Babe.

941
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,796
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

942
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,551
Have a good day.

I'm scared.

951
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:36,425
I'm scared to death.

952
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:39,633
Of what?

953
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:45,059
-Of dying.
-Everybody dies.

954
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,182
What are you really afraid of?

955
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:51,437
I didn't have enough time
to do all the things I wanted to do.

956
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:54,690
-Like what?
-Buy a house!

957
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:57,989
Have a baby.
Find somebody who loves me.

958
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:01,614
You have that.
Or, you had it.

959
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,319
How do you know?

960
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:07,157
He could just have said all that stuff
because he felt sorry for me.

961
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:11,120
He doesn't strike me as someone
who loved you out of pity.

962
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:13,125
You should try again.

963
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:17,675
-I don't know what his issues are.
-I don't care what his issues are.

964
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:21,471
-Do you love him?
-Um...

965
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:25,141
Do you love him?

966
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:27,560
-Do you?
-I do, I do, I do.

967
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:31,265
-Say it in a complete sentence.
-I love him. I love him.

968
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:34,567
I-- love him.

969
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:36,770
I really do.
I really love him.

970
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,948
Maybe you should go back down
and tell him.

971
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,697
-I can't go back down. I'm dead.
-You're not dead.

972
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:45,619
The car didn't actually hit you.

973
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:49,416
Aside from a little headache,
you should be fine.

974
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,542
Ah! Oop.

975
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:02,219
Ohh!

976
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:05,388
Ohh.

977
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,193
Oh look, he's right here.

978
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:26,240
-Mom? Hey.
-Right. Okay. I'll wait for you outside.

979
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:27,662
Thank you.

980
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:35,044
-(Marley): Hi.
-(Julian): Hi.

981
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:39,712
-What happened to you?
-A street hit me in the face.

982
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:43,636
-What?
-Can I talk to you?

983
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:46,681
-Yeah.
-Okay. Come on.

984
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,892
My whole life I've been so afraid
of guys lying to me,

985
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:57,145
not being there for me
and ending up Shafted like my mother.

986
01:13:57,224 --> 01:14:00,694
Somewhere along the line
I decided to take charge of my life,

987
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:04,616
and to never let anybody
ever get close enough to hurt me.

988
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,909
-Ever.
-Okay. Okay.

989
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:10,868
And then you come along.

990
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:14,076
With your nose in your books
and your yo-yos and your

991
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:19,380
spouting off ridiculous jokes like:
"My Mom sat on my-- face.“

992
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:24,298
-So you can see how I missed it.
-What?

993
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:25,924
What? You missed what?

994
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:44,146
You're my third wish.

995
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:47,992
I love you.

996
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:05,635
Put your turn signal on. Don't make me
guess which way you're gonna go.

997
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:08,213
(Beverley): Just surprise me.

998
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:12,266
Remember when I was little how I
used to masturbate all the time?

999
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,974
Do you remember when we went
to that rug store

1000
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:18,647
and I hopped up
on one of those rolled-up rugs?

1001
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:22,651
Then you gave me
a two-week time out

1002
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:26,527
and told me never to touch
my jingle bells again.

1003
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:31,611
Yeah, I remember that.

1004
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,537
You know?

1005
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:44,208
My whole life I think that was
the only time you were a bad Mom.

1006
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:49,841
Yet I was such a shit.

1007
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:51,714
You're a daughter.

1008
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:54,805
That's your job.

1009
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:03,313
Will you help me plan my funeral?

1010
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,275
Sure.

1011
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:12,194
I don't want it to be some sombre affair.
I want it to be a celebration.

1012
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:13,573
I want to put the

1013
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:17,206
f-u-n back in funeral.

1014
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:40,346
Hi.

1015
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:44,229
Listen, you've been a real bitch lately.
Really mean and ugly.

1016
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:46,982
I just want you to know
that I don't appreciate it.

1017
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:48,483
-You don't?
-No.

1018
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:51,816
Because I've done nothing
but support you

1019
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:55,824
-through this so-called difficult time.
-Well, it has been hard.

1020
01:16:55,903 --> 01:17:00,784
Please- listening to you
going on and on about

1021
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:03,870
feeling sick and "I'm too tired"

1022
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:08,584
and "Oh, that Vinnie
really rocked my world."

1023
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:10,839
-He was awesome wasn't he?
-He was.

1024
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:12,716
-So back to you.
-What?

1025
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:15,639
Your behaviour has really
made me angry. It has.

1026
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:18,888
But you wanna know what makes me
blow my top, see red

1027
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:24,441
and makes my blood boil
is the fact that I'm gonna miss you.

1028
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,481
So much.

1029
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:44,286
Do you think I could have
that dance now?

1030
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,246
No.

1031
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:51,717
That ship sailed so long ago.

1032
01:17:57,131 --> 01:18:00,476
You know?
I thought you'd never ask.

1033
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:30,589
You're just scared.

1034
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:34,294
-Break it down.
-Take all that. Aw. Take that.

1035
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:38,131
Woof. Woof.
I mean it's so high.

1036
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:49,024

Hi, Marley, it's Dad.

1037
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:52,979
I'm coming into town tonight
and I'd like to see you.

1038
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:56,282
I'll call you once I get to the hotel.

1039
01:18:56,357 --> 01:18:59,201
Hope you're doing well.
Bye.

1040
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,705
He sounds like he's making an effort.

1041
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:09,625
It’s too little too late.

1042
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:14,379
Mmm.

1043
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:19,555
Go ahead.

1044
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,309
You know, I don't know the guy,

1045
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:27,639
and he might be as big a schmuck
as you say he is,

1046
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:30,895
but, um, it might worth
listening to him.

1047
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:36,607
Some people have a hard time
opening up about their feelings.

1048
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,155
Low blow.

1049
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:54,666
(TV announcer): Goal!

1050
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:59,379
The Penne Arrabiata sounds good.

1051
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:03,056
Oh thanks, but I'm trying to lose
a couple of pounds.

1052
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:13,271
-What are we doing?
-What do you mean?

1053
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:17,571
Making chit-chat like nothing's wrong
between us. I hate it.

1054
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:21,025
-I'm trying to have a nice visit.
-By not saying anything?

1055
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:24,829
-What do you want me to do?
-Nothing. it's fine.

1056
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:29,325
-No. I'm here aren't I?
-Yes, Dad, physically you are here.

1057
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:32,662
-Marley, come on. I'm trying.
-Give the man a trophy.

1058
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:33,997
He's trying.

1059
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:38,835
Could we have just one pleasant meal?
Just one and then talk about this later?

1060
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,679
-Fine.
-Thank you.

1061
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:49,937
No. it's not fine.
I don't know if I have a "later".

1062
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:53,437
So we need to talk about this right now,
or I walk out the door

1063
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,643
and may never see you again.

1064
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:29,388
Marley, wait!

1065
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:34,894
I don't know what to do, kiddo.
Tell me what to do.

1066
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:37,192
Dad, I don't want to have to tell you.

1067
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:40,396
And I shouldn't have to tell you.

1068
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:44,567
Do you remember that time
probably 20 years ago?

1069
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:47,620
You said: "I'm glad
God brought me into this world,

1070
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:50,413
but I wish it was
from a different father."

1071
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:52,787
Do you remember that?

1072
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:56,587
And yet I said nothing,
because I didn't know what to say.

1073
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,714
But it killed me inside.

1074
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:04,838
And now my little girl is very sick
and I can't fix it.

1075
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:08,181
So please tell me what to say,

1076
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:11,352
because I can't have you
hating me like this anymore.

1077
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:15,731
I love you so very much, Marley.

1078
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:19,519
Just tell me what to do.

1079
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,693
You just did it.

1080
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:33,824
Thank you.

1081
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,667
(Marley): Renee?

1082
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:48,972
Renee!

1083
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:03,779
I know you're in here, so I'm just
gonna say what I came here to say,

1084
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:05,902
which is: I'm sorry.

1085
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:11,112
It really hurt when you started
distancing yourself, but it's okay.

1086
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:12,913
I get it.

1087
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:17,915
A new baby coming
and me-- leaving.

1088
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:24,797
It's not fair having to be so happy
and so sad at the same time, is it?

1089
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:31,257
Our friendship is one of the best things
in my life.

1090
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:34,935
I'm sorry I'm not gonna get
to know that little boy.

1091
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:38,765
But I know he'll be beautiful.
Just like Cammie.

1092
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:44,528
Oh, my God, that little girl is amazing.

1093
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,238
So, please, when she gets older

1094
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:53,617
tell her that I loved her
like she was my own.

1095
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:06,295
Bye.

1096
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:33,569
You sure you still want to do this?

1097
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,076
Yeah.

Really?

1118
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:18,136
Hey, what are you gonna do
after I'm gone?

1119
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,517
Hum?

1120
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:26,061
Come on. You got on my case
about not opening up.

1121
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:32,943
I just don't like thinking about it.

1122
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:36,946
Julian, I need to know
that you're gonna be okay.

1123
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,072
Oh, my God.

1124
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:40,449
We should talk about
what we're feeling.

1125
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:45,376
-Now I've created a monster.
-Yeah, you have.

1126
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:49,504
So?

1127
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:55,965
Um,

1128
01:26:57,254 --> 01:27:02,431
so-- this old man
he goes to the doctor,

1129
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:04,682
and he brings his wife along.

1130
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:07,685
It's the yearly physical,
so the doctor says:

1131
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:12,315
"l just need a urine sample,
a blood, a sperm and a stool sample."

1132
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:16,695
The old man can't hear very well,
so he looks over to his wife

1133
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:20,403
and asks: "What?
What is he saying?"

1134
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:24,240
And the wife yells back at him:
"He wants your underwear!"

1135
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:32,206
My work here is done.

1136
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:07,950

Ohh.

1137
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:18,964
Oh.

1138
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:10,471
So, I have to go back
to New York for a few days, but

1139
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:12,477
call me if you need anything. Okay?

1140
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:14,604
Okay, I will.

1141
01:29:15,809 --> 01:29:18,608
-I love you.
-I love you too.

1142
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:21,148
Bye.

1143
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:31,079
And this includes
a big opening party?

1144
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:36,455
Alright, that's what I want.
Great.

1145
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:39,841
The name is Sarah Walker.

1146
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:42,594
It's a surprise.

1147
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:47,178
(Marley): Okay, thank you very much.
Bye, bye.

1148
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:57,605
Mom, would you do me a favour
and give this to Sarah for me?

1149
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:02,314
She's gonna be here in a minute.
You can...

1150
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:05,237
Oh.

1151
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:10,831
I'll make sure she gets it.

1152
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:18,380
And this is for you.

1153
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:29,136
-it's for me?
-Hm.

1154
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:51,746
Mom?

1155
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:54,416
Yeah?

1156
01:30:54,491 --> 01:30:56,835
Will you take care of Stanley for me?

1157
01:30:58,119 --> 01:31:01,999
-I wouldn't have it any other way.
-Check.

1158
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:06,548
Ah.

1159
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:11,800
Ah.

1160
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:26,360
♪ a Mercedes Benz ♪

1161
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:29,192
You used to sing me that
to sleep every night.

1162
01:31:29,275 --> 01:31:36,625
♪ my friends all have Porsches,

1163
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:40,830

1164
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:44,633

01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:51,967
♪ oh Lord, won't you buy me
a Mercedes Benz ♪

1166
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:55,143
Wanna get the ball?
Go get it.

1167
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:58,101
Get it, buddy.

1168
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:03,977
Hey-

1169
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:09,317
I was gonna go for a jog up the hill.
Do you want to come?

1170
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:14,576
-Sure. You start. I'll catch right up.
-Okay.

1171
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:22,834
Woo! Yeah. Here we go.
Oh, Oh.

1172
01:32:24,497 --> 01:32:26,750
On second thought,
that's a really big hill.

1173
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:29,465
Pussy.

1174
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,593
I'm not afraid to admit it.

1175
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:36,684
Ah.

1176
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:43,608
When's Julian getting here?

1177
01:32:43,683 --> 01:32:46,653
He had to work late,
so I just left a message.

1178
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:51,362
Trying to let the poor man sleep.

1179
01:32:57,697 --> 01:32:59,074
-Sarah?
-Hm?

1180
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:00,625
I'm sorry.

1181
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:04,121
-What?
-I've been so wrapped up in all this,

1182
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:08,459
I haven't stopped to ask how
it was affecting all of you guys.

1183
01:33:08,541 --> 01:33:11,135
-Oh, that's...
-Ask how you're doing.

1184
01:33:11,211 --> 01:33:14,511
-It's...
-How are you're doing?

1185
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:23,398
How are you doing?

1186
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:27,527
Not so good.

1187
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:32,365
See?
I didn't know that.

1188
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:36,035
Why didn't you wish
not to die, huh?

1189
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:39,994
Hm, something else I wanted more.

1190
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:45,830
Well, I wish it.
I wish it right now. God?

1191
01:33:45,912 --> 01:33:50,793
Hey? God?
You listening?

1192
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:55,889
You can't take her away.
Okay?

1193
01:33:57,465 --> 01:33:59,888
I want her to stay here.

1194
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:06,017
It's not gonna work. You need
an anal probe and a morphine shooter.

1195
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:18,116
-Are you scared?
-No.

1196
01:34:21,447 --> 01:34:23,040
Not anymore.

1197
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:55,531
Marley?

1198
01:34:58,818 --> 01:35:00,240
Marley?

1199
01:35:06,326 --> 01:35:07,953
Marley?

1200
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:12,958
Hey-

1201
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:16,715

Marley...

1202
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:44,281
Here you go, sir.

1203
01:35:45,949 --> 01:35:47,496
This is Peter.

1204
01:35:53,831 --> 01:35:55,583
Ahh!

1205
01:36:57,812 --> 01:37:00,531

Hey you, it's me.

1206
01:37:01,983 --> 01:37:06,489
Oh, I didn't think
this was going to be so difficult.

1207
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:10,201
I thank God you came into my life.
I do.

1208
01:37:10,283 --> 01:37:12,877
Because you showed me
how to be the person

1209
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:16,456
I always imagined myself to be.

1210
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:18,633
That's not even
giving you enough credit,

1211
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:22,508
because until I met you
I had no idea who I could be.

1212
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:30,096
So-- take care and try
not to fall in love again. Ever.

1213
01:37:30,178 --> 01:37:31,851
Ever again.

1214
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:35,475
That's kind of a joke.

1215
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:39,695
-I love you.
-I love you.

1216
01:37:56,579 --> 01:38:01,631
Oh, oh, oh.
I know.

1217
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:38,504
(voice over Marley)
So, that's my story.

1218
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:41,924
I had some pretty amazing friends,
didn't I?

1219
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:46,379
And I include my parents in that group,
even though my whole life I blamed them

1220
01:38:46,462 --> 01:38:48,931
for, well, everything.

1221
01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:54,809
But the truth is: I was afraid.
I was afraid to trust and forgive.

1222
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:58,687
I was scared I wasn't enough.
But I was.

1223
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:18,536

(Julian): I just have to say: To Marley.

1224
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:20,371
(Everyone): To Marley!

1225
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:01,375
-Thank you, Marley.
-Thank you, Marley.

1226
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,255
Hi.

1227
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:16,264
Stanley.

1228
01:40:28,689 --> 01:40:31,363
(voice over Marley)
What I wouldn't give

1229
01:40:31,442 --> 01:40:36,664
to experience just one more time,
to feel that incredible sensation

1230
01:40:38,366 --> 01:40:42,997
when he looked at me
and I felt-- alive.
