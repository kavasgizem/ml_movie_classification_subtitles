wanted to come by a little later on.

his penis inside an asshole.

- No, have you?
- Oh, God, no.

00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:03,605
I'm gonna be right back.
I'll be right back, okay?

318
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,607
Or not! (LAUGHS)

319
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:09,144
No, that's being too ambitious.

320
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,203
Hey. Hey.

321
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,122
Albert, what the
hell are you doing?

322
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,415
Louise, we need to talk.

323
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,459
- It's 1:30 in the morning.
- We need to talk.

324
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,586
- And we need to talk tonight.
- What happened to your face?

325
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:29,965
I got in a fight with an animal
that I could not identify.

326
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,050
Okay, you're drunk.

327
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,469
I'm a smucks-dinnin' drunk.

328
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,804
I don't know what you want
from me, but it's late.

329
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:36,930
- I gotta go.
- Louise! Louise!

330
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,308
Louise, please, listen to me.
I love you, okay?

331
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,809
I love you.

332
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,145
And I just think if
we talked this out

333
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,105
that we can get
somewhere and fix it.

334
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,316
Look, Albert, you gotta go.

335
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:50,861
I'm sure you're right for
somebody else, just not for me.

336
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,488
Okay?

337
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,655
Good night.

338
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,275
Wait, let me just touch you.

339
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,744
You're being a fucking jerk!

340
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:12,124
Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

341
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,135
You know what?
I heard you fart once.

342
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,346
And it went...
(IMITATING FART NOISE)

343
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:20,683
And it was a sharp one.

344
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,935
A little sharpie poop-toot.

345
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,561

get with this gold, Plugger?

348

You know what I'm gonna get you?

349
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:39,827
I'm gonna get you a big old
stack of fresh-cut steaks.

350
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,161
(CHUCKLING) I bet you'd like that.

What can I do for you fellas?

361
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,440
Well, we're riding through
to Sherman Creek.

362
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,526
Be obliged if you could
tell us the shortest route.

363
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:15,863
Oh, yeah, I can help you with that.
(GRUNTS)

364
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,073
I got a map right here.

365
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,241
Yes, sir.

366
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,076
Oh.

367
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,954
You're on the main road now.

368
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:27,166
And the main road goes
right through Bullhead

369
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,793
and straight through
to Sherman Creek.

370
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,212
But if you want the quickest way,

371
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,423
I'd take Bilbee Pass.

372
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:38,469
Safer, too. Less chance
of bandits and such.

373
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,720
Thank you.

374
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:42,297
- You can keep that.
- Oh.

375
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,477
Uh, one more thing
you might do for us.

376

What's that?

377
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,806
You could show us the gold.

378
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,108
Gold? (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

379
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,486
I ain't got no gold.

380
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,237
I wish.

381
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:01,992

that stream's about panned out.

382

Old Plugger and I done give it up.

383

We're going on back into town.

(CHUCKLES) Aye. You see,
that's... That's just it.

You're heading back to town
in the middle of the day.

A prospector only does that
when he's found gold to sell.

387
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,843
Show it to me.

388
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,054
No, I swear to you, mister.

389
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,306
I ain't got no gold.

390
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:28,310
We're just going into
town to get some...

391

Whoa, whoa, whoa...

392
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,400
- Hold on, let me think here a minute.
- You do that.

393
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:38,395
I might just have a
little bit of gold.

394
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,990
Yeah, here it is.
I forgot all about it.

395
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,243
Here, take it.

396
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,737
Pick up your gun.

397
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,913
What?

398
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:51,500
Well, I'm not just gonna take
your gold. That'd be stealing.

399
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:54,503
You know what, old timer?
We'll shoot for it.

400

- Clinch.
- Shut up.

401
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,424

You just take the gold, okay?

402
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,843
Only a thief would do that.

403
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,886
Are you calling me a
thief, old timer?

404
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,263
No, no, no!

405
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,758
Then pick up your gun.

406
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,690
That's it.

407
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,226
Now point it at me.

408
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:27,828
We shoot on three.

God damn it, Clinch!

You didn't have to shoot him!

414
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,092
I know I didn't have
to, sweetheart.

415
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,636
He would've given you the gold!

416
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,973
The point is I had
to ask him twice.

417

00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:56,106
Don't you ever say that
to me in front of my men.

421
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,275
A man's wife will respect him.

ever in the history of girls.

That's it. Now, mount up.

00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,752
Take a look.

CLINCH: You, Enoch and
Jordy will ride with me.

430

We'll take Bilbee Pass
to Sherman Creek Trail.

you out of harm's way.

00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,375
that I got growing up.

476
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,626
You know? Right, guys?

477
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:21,877
(FARTS) Ow!

478
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,754
Oh, you getting the fart
needles again, Dad?

479
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,506
Never mind what I'm getting!

480
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:28,884
(LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY)
I love him so much!

481
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:32,137
Albert, I know you're taking this
breakup really hard, and I understand,

482
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,722
but you got to get
out of this funk.

483
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,767
I mean, you haven't shorn
your sheep in weeks.

484

(BLEATING)

485
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:41,772
Look, you don't know what
this is like, all right.

486
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:44,316
With all due respect, you have no
fucking clue what this is like.

487
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,026
All right? You're going
home every night

488
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:47,653
to your girlfriend who loves you.

489
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,947
- You're having sex with her, and you...
- Ah...

490
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:54,743
No, Ruth and I have...
We've never done that.

491
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,954
What do you mean you've...

492
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:59,415
You've never had sex with Ruth?

493
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:02,751
Yeah. No, no. Yeah.

494
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:06,463
Wait, doesn't she have sex with, like,
10 guys every day at the whorehouse?

495
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,757
On a slow day, yeah.

496
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,259
But you guys have never had sex?

497
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,929
No. No, Ruth wants to wait
until we get married.

498
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,432
You know, she's a
Christian and so am I,

499
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:20,394
and we want to save ourselves
for our wedding night.

500
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:22,896
Edward, have you... Have you
ever had sex with anyone?

501
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,815
Well, there was some shit with
my uncle, but that was...

502
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:28,944
You know, it's really hard
to remember all that stuff.

503

505
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:32,489
Yeah.

506
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,200
Um, I'll get out, I'll meet
some people. Yeah, thanks.

EDWARD: Man, I see kids everywhere
with those stick hoops lately.

510
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,254
I know. Me, too.

511
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:48,839
It's got to be bad for
their brains, right?

512
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,466
Yeah, it stunts their
attention span.

513
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,717
I read an article in the paper.

514
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,219
Yeah, I saw that. It's like
they lose the power to innovate

515
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,888
because they're staring at
the stick hoop all day.

516
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,097
Yep.

517
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:59,558
Oh, by the way, they're delivering
the town's ice shipment today.

518
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,726
You want to go watch?

00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,227
- Oh, yeah, that'd be fun.
- Yeah!

520
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,396
Yeah. It's always a thrill
when you get to see

521
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,148
that much ice all in one place.

522
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,816
Yeah, I think so, too.
I'm really excited.

00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:16,400
Holy shit.

Fucking Foy.

526
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:20,120
She told me she didn't
want to see anybody.

527
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:22,081
She told me she had
to work on herself.

528
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:23,540
Look at that.

529

Oh, my God. Fucking Foy!

00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:28,796
Oh, look at that. He's kissing her.

532
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:30,464
- EDWARD: He's frenching her.
- ALBERT: Fucking Foy!

533
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:32,132
Maybe you should grow a moustache.

534
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,717
No, I can't afford it.

535
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:36,220
The creams, the waxes, the lotions.

536
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:37,596
I don't have the money.

538

Hey, Albert, maybe we
should just go to church.

539
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,975
It'll make you feel a lot better.

00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:48,941
Why is it so big?

544
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:50,526
So it doesn't melt.

545
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:51,610
EDWARD: Oh.

546
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,195
That's so neat.

547
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:54,822
I know. It's actually really
interesting how they do it.

548
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:57,324
It's this one company out in Boston

549
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:59,993
that basically cuts
it in big blocks

550
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:03,539
from frozen lakes and ponds,
and they just ship it all over the...

like that part in the Bible

560
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,692
that applies to that situation.

I would also like to
offer a heartfelt prayer

to the family of James Addison,

563
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,158
who was killed this morning

564
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,826
while unloading the ice shipment.

565
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:44,038
James, we will think of
you lovingly this July

566
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,582
as we sip the cold summer beverages

567
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:48,292
for which you gave your life.

(WHISPERING) They're still
gonna use the fucking ice.

Now, before we end this
morning's service,

570
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:56,633
I would like to welcome two
new members to our community.

571
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:59,595
Lewis Barnes and his sister, Anna.

572
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,472
They've just moved
here to Old Stump

573
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,432
and they plan to build a farm.

574
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,351
And we wish them all the luck.

575
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:07,811
Well, that concludes
today's service.

576
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,772
So, may God bless you
for another week

577
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:12,441
and there is a mountain
lion warning in effect.

and I was thinking that we
could go dress shopping later.

need a new dress.

What's up, kiddo? Never

You don't have a moustache, though.

No, I know. I was thinking
about growing one.

I'm sorry, I can't...

596
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,170
- I said I was thinking about growing one.
- Oh.

Excuse me, I have to
use the powder room.

And just what kind of moustache
are you looking to grow?

599
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:25,514
Um, a big one.

600
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:27,516
Like one of those
ones that goes down

601
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:29,560
along the side of my mouth,

602
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:32,980
and then goes up the
edge of my jaw,

603
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:36,525
and then becomes my sideburns,

604
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:39,486
and then becomes my hair.

kind of moustache

00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:12,788
and I'm like, "What?
Can I do all that?"

635
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,373
(LAUGHING)

636
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:16,709
Yeah.

637
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,128
You know, uh, Ruth,
I've been thinking.

638
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:21,496
About what?

639
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:23,132
Well, I love you.

640
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:25,050
Well, I love you, too.

641
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:28,470
And we've been together
for a long time.

642
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:29,596
Wh...

643
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:34,893
What do you think about us
spending the night together?

644
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:38,147
You mean having sex?

645
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:39,898
Maybe not right away, you know?

646
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,109
We could maybe lie together
for the first couple of times

647
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,736
and see how it feels,
and then go from there.

648
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,404
But, Eddie, we're Christians.

649
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:46,989
I know we're Christians

650
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,325
and I want to do the correct
thing in the eyes of the Lord.

651
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:53,328
But if we really do
love each other,

652
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:55,581
don't you think God
would be okay with it?

653
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:58,000
I don't know.

654
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:01,170
I mean, you're talking about
pre-marital relations.

655
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:04,673
Oh! You've got a little thing
right here. I'll get it.

656
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:07,468
Oops. Oopsie.

657
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,511
- Thank you.
- Oh.

658
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,637
That's it, I'm out.

659
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:11,930
What?

660
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:15,142
I'm done. I'm leaving.
I'm going to San Francisco.

661
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:17,144
What, are you serious?
Because of Louise?

662
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:20,856
Yes, I'm serious. And, yes,
it is because of Louise.

663
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:22,191
I don't know how I
lasted this long.

664
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:24,151
I hate the frontier,
I hate everything in it.

665
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:27,154
Well, what am I gonna do?
I'm your best friend.

666
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:31,992
I know. That's... That's why
I want you to have these.

667
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:34,244
Albert, these are
your favorite socks.

668
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:36,697
Yeah.

669
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:39,741
And I want you to have that.

670
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:44,213
Edward, this is your
lucky handkerchief.

671
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:45,589
Yeah.

672
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,834
It's sticky.

673
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:52,179
Well, hello to you, too!

674
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,890
James, I found the friendly locals.
(CHUCKLES)

675
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:58,811
So he said, "Why don't you
go blow your own horse?"

676
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:00,062
(LAUGHS)

677
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:02,356
Hey, watch it, pal.

678
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,566
I think you owe me a drink, fella.

679
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,402
The hell I do.

680
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:08,320
You best watch where you stand.

681
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:11,281
I don't think you heard me.

682
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:13,242
I'm thirsty.

683
00:33:13,243 --> 00:33:18,113
Then why don't you go on down
the river and take a dunk?

684
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:21,074
Last chance, kid.

685
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,809
(EXHALES)

686
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,011
(CHUCKLING)

687
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:42,938
(GASPS)

688
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:45,107
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

689
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:46,483
Oh, shit!

690
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:48,685
(GRUNTS)

691
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:53,365
Albert, hurry! Get in position!

692
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:55,817
(GRUNTING)

693
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,622
(GROANING)

694
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:02,666
We got our own thing
going on over here.

695
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,293
Yeah, nobody needs
to get in on this.

696
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:06,420
We're both getting
hurt pretty badly.

697
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:08,505
(GRUNTING)

698
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:10,966
(GROANING)

699
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,760
Nobody needs to come over here.

700
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:15,054
This fight is way more
violent than yours...

701
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:17,473
All those other guys' fights.

702
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:19,800
(GROANING)

703
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:28,984
(GRUNTING)

704
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:31,153
- (GROANING)
- Oh!

705
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:32,488
You actually hit me!

706
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,614
I'm so sorry.

707
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:34,698
You fucker!

708
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,033
I put a new move in there.

709
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,409
You don't just put a new move in.

710
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,861
That's why we have the meetings.

711
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,491
(GROANING)

712
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:48,337
That's where it hurts.
Like, right there.

713
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:49,713
Like, right underneath my eye.

714
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:51,006
Yeah, there's a little red spot.

715
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:52,758
Ow! Careful, it's tender.

716
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:55,335
(GRUNTING)

717
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:15,864
- Thank you.
- Sure.

718
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:18,066
(GUNSHOT)

719
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,777
Shit. Come on.

720
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:23,414
Whoa!

721
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:24,540
(SIGHS)

722
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,083
Sorry about that.

723
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:28,127
It's kind of a regular
occurrence around here.

724
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,212
- Really?
- Yeah.

725
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:31,380
(BOTH SIGH)

726
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:34,550
Hey, pretty fast hands back there.

727
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,760
- Oh...
- I guess you're a real hero.

728
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:40,514
Me? No, I'm not the hero.

729
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:43,142
I'm the guy in the crowd making
fun of the hero's shirt.

730
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:44,601
- That's who I am.
- Oh.

731
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:48,188
- Hey, look who's here.
- Who's this?

732
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,356
This is Plugger.

733
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:51,934
Hey, Plugger.

734
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:55,446
So, that... That was your
brother in there, huh?

735
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:58,907
Yeah, Lewis. He's always
been a little rambunctious.

736
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:02,494
Yeah, he seems like a great guy.
I'm Albert, by the way.

737
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:04,204
Anna.

738
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,622
You guys just got into town?

739
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:07,166
Yeah.

740
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:09,251
Welcome to our awesome town.

741
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:10,586
Thanks.

742
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:12,963
Lewis and I just came
out from Kansas City.

743
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:14,465
Oh, Kansas.

744
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:16,258
No, it's in Missouri.

745
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:18,761
Oh, right. That's
annoying and weird.

746
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:19,928
We were wanting a change,

747
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:22,890
so we came out to the frontier
looking to build a farm.

748
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:24,391
- Oh, that's what I do.
- Really?

749
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,602
Yeah, I got a farm about
2 miles from here.

750
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:27,895
Oh, cattle?

751
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:29,521
Uh, no, sheep.

752
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:31,106
- Oh.
- Yep.

753
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:33,734
Well, that's got to be
fulfilling work, though, right?

754
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:34,943
Ah, yeah, it's great.

755
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,489
It's like being a dog walker
for 150 really stupid dogs.

756
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,823
(LAUGHS)

757
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:41,575
- ALBERT: Oh, shit, Plugger!
- ANNA: Oh, my God!

758
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:43,577
- Plugger, give it to me. (GROANING)
- Jesus, what is that?

759
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:45,662
It's the mayor.

760
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:47,164
- (GLASS SHATTERS)
- (WOMAN SCREAMING)

761
00:36:47,165 --> 00:36:50,158
Oh, shit!

762
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:53,379
So, how did you guys meet?

763
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,131
Uh, she moved to town
a couple years ago

764
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:59,134
to take over the schoolmarm job.

765
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:03,681
Our old schoolmarm got her throat
slit by a fast-moving tumbleweed.

766
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:05,474
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

767
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:06,767
In front of the kids?

768
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:09,103
Oh, yeah. Yeah. All of them.

769
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:10,312
ANNA: Let me help you.

770
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:14,182
That is just painful to watch.

771
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:19,863
And, you know, it's like the
whole time we were together

772
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:22,741
I just remember thinking,

773
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:26,695
"How can I possibly be this happy?

774
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:27,788
"She likes me now,

775
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:29,748
"but one day, she
is gonna figure out

776
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:32,534
"that she is too good for me."

777
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:37,414
And then one day, she did.

778
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:43,795
I feel like I finally tricked one
girl into falling in love with me

779
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:46,849
and then I lost her.

780
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:50,594
I think you have this
whole thing upside down.

781
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:53,188
I mean, it sounds like you've bent
over backwards for this girl,

782
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:54,732
but what has she given you back?

783
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:57,359
I told you, she allowed
me to be happy

784
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,695
in a part of the world that
is otherwise a living hell.

785
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:01,613
"Allowed"? Wow.

786
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:03,615
That's kind of fucked up that
you would use that word.

787
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:05,909
You know that, right?

788
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:09,621
All I know is that there
is nothing for me out here

789
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:12,115
if I don't have her.

790
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,418
ANNA: Well,

791
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:17,296
if this Foy guy is
that much of a douche,

792
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:20,591
she'll figure it out
if she's smart.

793
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:23,218
Sometimes a girl has to get a
few assholes out of her system

going to the stupid fair.

Louise was right. I can't
keep track of them.

1107
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,902
There was a sheep in the
whorehouse last week.

1108
00:52:33,903 --> 00:52:35,320
- Really?
- Yeah.

1109
00:52:35,321 --> 00:52:37,322
Wandered in there, and then
when I went to pick it up,

1110
00:52:37,323 --> 00:52:39,074
somehow, it had made $20.

1111
00:52:39,075 --> 00:52:41,610
(LAUGHING)

1112
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:46,915
But, you know, thank you
anyway for what you said.

1113
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:49,835
Oh, look, the West fucking sucks,

1114
00:52:49,836 --> 00:52:51,587
but the frontier is
not your problem.

1115
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:52,755
It's you.

1116
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:54,923
You need a little confidence
boost, my friend.

1117
00:52:54,924 --> 00:52:57,459
Now, aim up, sheep boy.

1118
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:07,770
- Oh!
- Hey!

1119
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:09,188
- There we go!
- See? There!

1120
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:10,814
All righty. That's one.

1121
00:53:10,815 --> 00:53:15,611
So, all I gotta do is get Foy to let
me shoot 16 times before he shoots

1122
00:53:15,612 --> 00:53:16,862
and then I win!

1123
00:53:16,863 --> 00:53:18,280
You're gonna do great, I promise.

1124
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:20,983
- Easy.
- We're gonna get there.

1125
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:32,387
(GUNSHOT)

1126
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,066
- (LAUGHING) Hey!
- Yes!

1127
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:19,026
(SCREAMING)

1128
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:20,110
Oh!

00:55:20,111 --> 00:55:24,231
God damn it, Albert!
No more friends!

1130
00:55:30,955 --> 00:55:32,748
ANNA:
You know, you did great today.

1131
00:55:32,749 --> 00:55:34,750
So much better than last week.

1132
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:37,753
And I have a surprise for you.

1133
00:55:37,754 --> 00:55:40,047
You have earned one of Anna Barnes'

1134
00:55:40,048 --> 00:55:44,251
very special
super-super-secret cookies.

1135
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:47,096
Mmm-hmm.

1136
00:55:47,097 --> 00:55:49,014
- Wait, what is this?
- Mmm-hmm?

1137
00:55:49,015 --> 00:55:50,974
This is a pot... This is
a pot cookie, isn't it?

1138
00:55:50,975 --> 00:55:52,309
- It's a pot cookie.
- No, no, no.

1139
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:53,435
No. I don't do well
with that stuff at all.

1140
00:55:53,436 --> 00:55:54,520
It's a pot cookie.

1141
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:56,313
Yeah, I know. No, thank you.

1142
00:55:56,314 --> 00:55:57,564
Just have a little bit with me.

1143
00:55:57,565 --> 00:56:00,401
My worst fear is to OD
on a recreational drug.

1144
00:56:00,402 --> 00:56:01,860
- (STAMMERS) No, thank you.
- On a pot cookie?

1145
00:56:01,861 --> 00:56:03,487
The last time somebody
gave me one of these

1146
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:05,948
I became convinced that prairie
dogs could read my mind.

1147
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:07,866
Just take a little bit.

1148
00:56:07,867 --> 00:56:09,702
- I'll take a very, very small bite.
- Just a small bite.

1149
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:12,905
- A very small bite.
- That's it.

1150
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:15,541
Are you kidding me?

1151
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:17,126
Nope. Deadly serious.

1152
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:18,794
- (LAUGHING)
- Let's see what this does

1153
00:56:18,795 --> 00:56:20,337
and if I don't throw
myself off this cliff

1154
00:56:20,338 --> 00:56:21,839
during some awful
freak-out, then...

1155
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,507
Just take that little
bit, right there.

1156
00:56:23,508 --> 00:56:25,551
- Well, now you've touched it.
- (LAUGHING)

1157
00:56:25,552 --> 00:56:29,888
Take the other side. There you go.

1158
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:32,141
There.

1159
00:56:32,142 --> 00:56:35,886
And now, we just wait
for the sun to set.

1160
00:56:46,698 --> 00:56:49,491
This is really weird.

1161
00:56:49,492 --> 00:56:52,694
- Is it supposed to be like this?
- (CHUCKLING)

1162
00:56:54,247 --> 00:56:55,456
You gave me the right
amount, right?

1163
00:56:55,457 --> 00:56:59,284
You don't think I took too much?

1164
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:02,921
- Just ride it out.
- This is...

1165
00:57:02,922 --> 00:57:05,299
Wow, my bones are in
really deep today.

1166
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:08,635
Like, there's a lot more
skin than there usually is.

1167
00:57:08,636 --> 00:57:10,679
I think my body is padding
up for the winter,

1168
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,139
which is weird, because
it's not winter.

1169
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,390
But there's a lot more there.

(SWALLOWING)

1173
00:57:19,064 --> 00:57:21,815
There's something wrong
with my swallowing.

1174
00:57:21,816 --> 00:57:23,484
This is not how I usually swallow.

What, what, what?

1178
00:57:26,863 --> 00:57:28,947
He knows what we're doing,
he knows what this is.

1179
00:57:28,948 --> 00:57:30,324
He knows what this is.

1180
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:33,285
I don't wanna... No,
I don't wanna join.

You look amazing.

1194
00:59:06,629 --> 00:59:08,630

No.

I've never done formal before.

1199
00:59:15,972 --> 00:59:18,307
And the lady at the boutique
told me to buy this

1200
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:19,725
and no one else is wearing this.

(STAMMERS) Who cares what...

These are all fuckers.
You look fantastic.

1203

I look like Jane Austen
threw up all over me.

(LAUGHING) You do not look
like Jane Austen threw...

No, you look absolutely beautiful.

1206

You can breathe in
that thing, right?

1207
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:33,906
There's nothing I like more than

1208
00:59:33,907 --> 00:59:35,657
putting on some
loose, baggy clothes,

1209
00:59:35,658 --> 00:59:37,409
and just being able to relax.

1210
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:39,912
Yeah, this is an end-of-the-workday
outfit you have on.

I'm very glad I

a woman can make today

is to simulate a fat ass.

- That is a simulation of a fat ass, right there.
- Thank you.

1220
00:59:55,845 --> 00:59:59,348
If I was a black guy, this is the
meanest trick you could play on me.

1221

Because I'd be like,
"Oh, my God! Look.

"There's a fat ass, my favorite."

like, "Oh, shit, it's a big joke."

I know, exactly, because
when you lift it up

Hello, Foy. Hey, Louise.

Hey, Albert.

01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:49,833
So, big day tomorrow.

1265
01:01:49,834 --> 01:01:52,503
Care for a last dance?

1266
01:01:52,504 --> 01:01:53,962
With you?

1267
01:01:53,963 --> 01:01:55,547
No, not with me.

1268
01:01:55,548 --> 01:01:56,715
- I mean, the dance.
- Oh!

1269
01:01:56,716 --> 01:01:58,967
Yeah. No, yeah, no.
She and I are gonna dance.

1270
01:01:58,968 --> 01:02:01,470
And now, to serenade us
for the sweetheart dance,

it up, you change the subject.

that much to tell.

yours, I suppose.

deeper than mutual love.

It's true, right?

If two people hate the same
things, it creates a bond.

01:07:56,659 --> 01:07:58,035
No, in the picture, he's smiling!

I bought that off a peddler who was
coming through town last week.

01:08:03,249 --> 01:08:04,500
I didn't even know this existed.

01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:06,794
- And apparently, he's not insane.
- Bullshit!

1415
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:07,961
That's what the guy told me.

1416
01:08:07,962 --> 01:08:10,172
It takes 30 seconds
to take a photograph.

1417
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:11,590
This guy would have
had to sit there

- Albert.

1905

Don't be stupid, Albert!
Get out of here!

1906
01:44:22,262 --> 01:44:23,595
Get out of here!

1907
01:44:23,596 --> 01:44:24,972
Too late for that.

1908

You've been with my wife.

1911
01:44:31,187 --> 01:44:33,564
Well, we haven't actually done it,

1912
01:44:33,565 --> 01:44:36,817
if that makes any
kind of a difference.

1913
01:44:36,818 --> 01:44:39,153
Okay, look, look, look.
Here's my idea, okay?

1914
01:44:39,154 --> 01:44:41,030
You're a pretty tough guy, yeah?

1915

Holy fuck.

1937
01:45:41,716 --> 01:45:43,509
Okay, look, look, look!
Before you kill me,

1938
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:45,552
just grant me a few
last words. All right?

1939
01:45:45,553 --> 01:45:47,763
Make it quick.

1940
01:45:47,764 --> 01:45:49,682

This is not her fault.

1944
01:45:53,645 --> 01:45:55,688
I kissed her, she didn't
kiss me, all right?

1945
01:45:55,689 --> 01:45:57,815
It's not her fault.

1946
01:45:57,816 --> 01:45:59,608
I mean, she didn't tell
me she was married,

1947
01:45:59,609 --> 01:46:01,402
so it's a little bit
her fault, I guess.

1948
01:46:01,403 --> 01:46:02,945
So, yeah, I guess
that's kind of true.

1949
01:46:02,946 --> 01:46:06,031
So, maybe just shoot
her in the arm.

Um, my grandparents were Arabic.

1953
01:46:10,829 --> 01:46:13,288
So, I'm required by
Muslim tradition

1954
01:46:13,289 --> 01:46:16,250
to recite the Islamic death
chant immediately before dying.

You okay, boss?

What's happening to me?

1962
01:46:47,657 --> 01:46:51,493
You know, there are a million
ways to die in the West, Clinch.

1963

There's, uh, famine,
disease, gunfights.

And, uh, wild animals.
You know, like snakes.

1965
01:46:58,418 --> 01:46:59,918
And, you know, the funny thing is,

1966
01:46:59,919 --> 01:47:01,795
you don't even have to get bitten.

1967
01:47:01,796 --> 01:47:03,589
All you need is a
little bit of the venom

1968
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:05,341
introduced into your bloodstream

1969
01:47:05,342 --> 01:47:07,426
and you're pretty much screwed.

1970

a certain amount of venom</i>

rattler into a hollow-tip bullet,</i>

1972
01:47:12,766 --> 01:47:14,683
<i>you really only need one shot.</i>

1973
01:47:14,684 --> 01:47:18,270
<i>Now, I knew my aim wasn't good enough
to hit you anywhere important.</i>

1974
01:47:18,271 --> 01:47:20,356
<i>But if I caught you by surprise...</i>

1975
01:47:20,357 --> 01:47:23,359
<i>Well, Anna taught me just enough
to get me in the ballpark.</i>

1976
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:25,778
And just a small amount
of venom in an open wound

1977
01:47:25,779 --> 01:47:27,321
is enough to kill a man if he's...
