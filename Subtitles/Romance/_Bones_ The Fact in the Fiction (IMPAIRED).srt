1
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:24,920
MAN (over phone):
I'm telling you, this company

2
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:27,740
is poised to make a killing
at only $13 a share.

3
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:29,184
I don't care if
it's 13 cents

4
00:00:29,218 --> 00:00:31,219
a share, I'm not buying, Danny.

5
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,138
I'm out of the game.
(chuckles)

6
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:35,273
I've tasted freedom, man.

7
00:00:35,307 --> 00:00:36,775
The city's poison.

8
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,510
The only green I care about now
is the kale I'm growing.

9
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:41,363
(laughter over phone)
Laugh it up, Danny.

10
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:44,366
You laugh it up from
your smog-filled city office.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,851
I'm in God's country,
I'm doing God's work.

12
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:48,703
And he's looking out for me.

13
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:50,012
I bet he is.

14
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:51,623
Just visit, dude.
That's all I'm saying.

15
00:00:51,624 --> 00:00:52,574
I will, I promise.

16
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,242
I love kale.

17
00:00:54,293 --> 00:00:55,744
Oh!
(coughs)

18
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:57,128
Hey, what's wrong?
Too much fresh air?

19
00:00:57,163 --> 00:00:58,713
Oh, God, I don't know.

20
00:00:58,748 --> 00:01:01,132
Just smells like a dead animal,
that's all.

21
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:03,752
What the hell is that?

22
00:01:03,803 --> 00:01:06,171
Oh, God. Oh, God!

23
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:08,506
(gears grinding)
How do you stop this thing?

24
00:01:14,063 --> 00:01:16,514
(engine stops)

25
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,867
What? What? What's going on?

26
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:20,819
Hey, Chip, what's going on?

27
00:01:20,853 --> 00:01:22,487
(screams)

28
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:25,156
I just killed a dead guy!

29
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:32,664
(indistinct chatter)

30
00:01:32,698 --> 00:01:34,282
(camera shutter clicking)

31
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,034
BOOTH:
<i>Okay, just think of it</i>

32
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:37,786
as an investment for our future.

33
00:01:37,837 --> 00:01:39,954
For Parker, for Christine.
Asteroid mining?

34
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:41,005
Yeah, asteroid mining.

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,006
I did my
research, okay?

36
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,091
The head of the
Jet Propulsion Lab

37
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:45,076
says it's possible,
and the two guys

38
00:01:45,094 --> 00:01:47,178
who sent the rover
to Mars, they agree.

39
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:49,547
The microgravity technologies
required to do so

40
00:01:49,581 --> 00:01:51,516
don't even exist, Booth.
You know what?

41
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,301
There was a time
when radios and-and railroads,

42
00:01:53,352 --> 00:01:56,104
they didn't exist,
but people, they got rich.

43
00:01:56,138 --> 00:01:57,722
Why are you looking
at me like that?

44
00:01:57,756 --> 00:01:59,607
Like a schoolteacher.
Every time I have a good idea...

45
00:01:59,642 --> 00:02:01,092
Anyway, just look at the bones.

46
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,594
Why did the farmer
run over the remains?

47
00:02:03,612 --> 00:02:05,780
He was an investment banker
trying to get back to nature.

48
00:02:05,815 --> 00:02:08,199
I'm guessing the tractor
didn't handle like his Beemer.

49
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:09,984
Well, according to
the shallow grave here,

50
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:11,453
shish kebob,
he was definitely murdered.

51
00:02:11,487 --> 00:02:13,938
The presence of
<i>Nicrophorus americanus,</i>

52
00:02:13,956 --> 00:02:16,124
along with some of its larvae,
suggest the murder took place

53
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:17,312
five days ago.

54
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,960
Right. You believe
in asteroid mining?

55
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:20,662
Are you kidding me? It's
the only way that the species

56
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:21,946
is gonna survive.

57
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:23,748
Did you hear that?
I am a visionary.

58
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:25,166
You're gonna be
an asteroid miner?

59
00:02:25,217 --> 00:02:26,117
Yeah.

60
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:29,120
I didn't ask that.

61
00:02:29,138 --> 00:02:32,123
Don't want to know.
Please explain the difficulty to him

62
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:34,792
of retrieving
a 500-ton asteroid.

63
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,493
No. Not my place.

64
00:02:36,518 --> 00:02:37,645
HODGINS: No, no, no.
No, you just put it

65
00:02:37,646 --> 00:02:39,814
in a lunar orbit
and send some guys up there.

66
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:42,450
I think it's really
simple, actually.

67
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:44,302
Is she looking at me
like an angry schoolteacher?

68
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,821
Oh, yeah, yeah. She does that a lot.
BRENNAN: We're here to work.

69
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:48,857
These bones have been
heavily scavenged.

70
00:02:48,908 --> 00:02:52,410
The three-cornered
puncture marks indicate coyotes.

71
00:02:52,444 --> 00:02:54,312
Oh, do you think
they ran off with the head?

72
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,997
We've got techs searching
the area for it.

73
00:02:56,031 --> 00:03:00,201
Flattened anterior and posterior
sides of the victim's

74
00:03:00,252 --> 00:03:02,704
femoral neck indicate
a Hispanic male.

75
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:05,089
Well, it's tough to get
an I.D. without the head.

76
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:06,875
Easier than capturing
an asteroid.

77
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:08,543
Hey. I am on your side, man.

78
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:09,660
I need all
of the remains

79
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:11,546
and the aerator
brought back to the lab.

80
00:03:11,597 --> 00:03:12,997
BOOTH:
Right.

81
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,388
BOOTH: <i>Look, they just need</i>
<i>$2.6 billion in seed money.</i>

82
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,173
I mean, that's like
a sports team almost

83
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:24,108
when you think about it.
Plus, the platinum alone,

84
00:03:24,143 --> 00:03:26,510
it's worth about $50 billion.
Why do you care what I think?

85
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:27,729
Why? Because

86
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,113
my platinum is your platinum,

87
00:03:29,148 --> 00:03:31,032
and your platinum
is my platinum.

88
00:03:33,035 --> 00:03:35,787
$2,500 is a lot for you,
and there are no guarantees.

89
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:37,822
Well, there never are.
I mean, look at us.

90
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,575
Huh? No one ever thought
that we would pay off.

91
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:42,293
(chuckles)

92
00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:44,045
Bringing back that much platinum

93
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,014
could cause the bottom to drop
out of the platinum market.

94
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,333
I'm sorry, are you trying
to be supportive?

95
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:49,551
I thought I was.

96
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:52,086
I was discussing this
as if it's reasonable.

97
00:03:52,137 --> 00:03:53,421
Dr. Brennan!

98
00:03:54,223 --> 00:03:55,206
Yes?

99
00:03:55,224 --> 00:03:56,558
I've got a surprise for you.

100
00:03:56,592 --> 00:03:57,875
Wait till you see this.

101
00:03:57,893 --> 00:03:59,177
FBI. Get your hand out
(customers exclaim)

102
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:00,895
of the bag, get on the ground now.
Okay.

103
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,597
Now. Now!
Okay, okay, okay.

104
00:04:02,648 --> 00:04:05,250
Take it easy.
No problems.

105
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:08,403
Smith & Wesson 1911, right?
A man of tradition, I see.

106
00:04:08,437 --> 00:04:09,904
That's a very cool gun.
It's gonna be

107
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:11,773
the last thing you see
if you don't shut your mouth.

108
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:12,775
Booth, what are you doing?

109
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,058
What do you mean what am
I doing? He's all bloody.

110
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:16,110
Do you really think he's got a
bouquet of flowers in that bag?

111
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:18,121
He's right. I-I don't have
a bouquet of flowers...

112
00:04:18,163 --> 00:04:21,366
Shut up. Put your head
on the ground. Slide the bag

113
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,734
very easily
across the floor.

114
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:24,902
Don't do anything stupid.

115
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,004
Here.

116
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:27,538
(customers scream)

117
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:29,340
It's your victim's skull.

118
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,876
Hi, I'm your new intern.

119
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:35,579

123
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,751
Why wasn't I notified
about the new intern?

124
00:05:16,786 --> 00:05:19,137
Have you read
all your e-mails, Dr. Brennan?

125
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:21,673
Well, only the ones
with a subject line

126
00:05:21,707 --> 00:05:23,258
pertaining to a specific case.

127
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:25,794
Well, I suggest you read
the ones with the subject line

128
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:27,245
"Personnel."

129
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,930
Is there a problem
with Dr. Wells?

130
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:32,667
He brought a skull
into the diner in a satchel.

131
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:33,969
He's enthusiastic.

132
00:05:34,003 --> 00:05:37,222
He tracked the skull
to a coyote den six miles

133
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:39,841
from the crime scene.
Well, that is enthusiastic, but...

134
00:05:39,859 --> 00:05:40,809
He hasn't learned

135
00:05:40,843 --> 00:05:42,077
our protocols yet.

136
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:43,871
I think you'll find him
a quick study though.

137
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:44,830
Based on what?

138
00:05:44,864 --> 00:05:47,616
Dr. Wells has a PhD in physics,

139
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,685
a masters in both astronomy
and wildlife ecology,

140
00:05:50,703 --> 00:05:52,404
and he's two credits short

141
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:54,406
of a masters
in forensic anthropology.

142
00:05:54,457 --> 00:05:56,186
Well, how was I supposed
to know that?

143
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:58,494
Well, perhaps
you should read the e-mails

144
00:05:58,628 --> 00:06:00,528
with the subject line
"Intern Résumés."

145
00:06:00,546 --> 00:06:01,997
He's also passed the bar.

146
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:04,332
It's like getting five interns
for the price of one.

147
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:06,918
Except that he brought me
the skull in a bag

148
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:09,871
made of recycled plastic,
which produces condensation,

149
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:12,874
which could have severely
compromised crucial evidence.

150
00:06:12,892 --> 00:06:15,177
Which is why I rushed
the skull to you

151
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:16,678
at the diner, Dr. Brennan.

152
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:19,014
You see, condensation starts
after three hours.

153
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:21,600
I got you the skull
in an hour and 45 minutes.

154
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:22,984
That's simple physics.

155
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,820
And the plastic
was recycled so...

156
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:28,039
good for the environment.
HODGINS: Can we please

157
00:06:28,074 --> 00:06:29,557
de-spike this dude
so I can start picking

158
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:30,442
through his clothing?

159
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:32,393
All in good time,
Dr. Hodgins.

160
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:33,662
What should I do now?

161
00:06:33,696 --> 00:06:36,998
Tell Dr. Brennan
what you've deduced so far.

162
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:38,617
Induced, actually.
Going from the specific

163
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:40,902
to the general,
lack of cut marks

164
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,671
on the gonial angle

165
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:45,790
of the mandible, underside
of chin and cervical vertebrae

166
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:48,593
leave me no reason to suspect
that this skull was removed

167
00:06:48,628 --> 00:06:50,629
by anything
other than the coyotes.

168
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,048
So... not a zombie?

169
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:55,183
Zombies have to be beheaded

170
00:06:55,218 --> 00:06:57,085
or they eat your brains.
BRENNAN: There are

171
00:06:57,103 --> 00:07:00,472
no such things as zombies
or vampires or ghosts.

172
00:07:00,523 --> 00:07:02,724
The first law
of thermodynamics states

173
00:07:02,758 --> 00:07:05,260
that energy is neither
created nor destroyed.

174
00:07:05,278 --> 00:07:06,528
So when we die,

175
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:08,763
all that energy has
to go somewhere, right?

176
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:09,764
I believe

177
00:07:09,782 --> 00:07:11,032
that if we die
with an abundance

178
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:12,701
of this power,
it can become

179
00:07:12,735 --> 00:07:15,237
forever imprinted
on the immediate environment.

180
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:17,455
And that imprint, that's our ghost?
Mm-hmm.

181
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,207
Can we keep him?

182
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:21,609
I haven't decided yet.
There appears to be

183
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:24,546
a strange glow emanating
from the victim's inferior

184
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,615
nasal conchae.

185
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:28,833
HODGINS:
Ooh, ghosty.

186
00:07:32,305 --> 00:07:34,306
SWEETS:
<i>The guy literally</i>

187
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,057
fought off coyotes
to get the skull back.

188
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:37,292
Yeah.
That's awesome.

189
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,561
Coyotes, they just run away
if you yell at them.

190
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:43,265
I know, but still, to face
a pack of wild animals alone...

191
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:45,850
I'm sure you'd just bore them
to death with your shrinky talk.

192
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:48,103
A-And I'm sure you could just
break their hearts

193
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:50,805
with your mean, mean words.

194
00:07:50,823 --> 00:07:53,241
Wow.
Yeah, wow.

195
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:56,144
So, the brother is the victim's
only family that you found?

196
00:07:56,162 --> 00:07:57,779
So far. Okay,
Hodgins found traces

197
00:07:57,813 --> 00:08:00,248
of glow-in-the-dark auto paint
in the victim's nose.

198
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:02,701
It's rare stuff apparently,
and he traced it back

199
00:08:02,752 --> 00:08:04,152
to the brother's auto body shop.

200
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,587
You know, driving
a glow-in-the-dark car seems

201
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:07,539
like an excellent safety
feature, doesn't it?

202
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,550
Don't say stuff like that
when we get there, okay?

203
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:11,259
Look, the guy's brother is dead.

204
00:08:11,294 --> 00:08:13,378
I know. I'm just... telling you.

205
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:15,263
And... I'm not wrong.

206
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,388
Oh, God. Yes.

207
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,141
That's my little
brother Benji.

208
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:27,959
Benjamin.

209
00:08:27,994 --> 00:08:29,344
He's dead?

210
00:08:29,362 --> 00:08:30,812
Yes, sir.

211
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:32,063
We're sorry
for your loss.

212
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:34,482
Who did this?
BOOTH: Well, we're not sure yet.

213
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:36,318
He worked here, right?
Yeah.

214
00:08:36,352 --> 00:08:38,286
Why didn't you report him missing?
Benji was in college.

215
00:08:38,321 --> 00:08:39,738
Finals coming up,
I gave him a week off

216
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,506
to hole up and study.
First one ever

217
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,041
in our family to go to college.

218
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:46,007
Is there any other family
we should notify, Mr. Garcia?

219
00:08:46,032 --> 00:08:46,578
No.

220
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:48,963
It's just me and Benji. Mom died

221
00:08:48,998 --> 00:08:52,033
four years ago, Dad took off
when we were little kids.

222
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:53,368
What happened to my brother?

223
00:08:53,386 --> 00:08:55,337
Well, his remains
are still being examined.

224
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:57,372
Oh, God. That's bad.

225
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,940
You find his truck?
BOOTH: Why would

226
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:00,375
the truck be the first thing
you bring up?

227
00:09:00,393 --> 00:09:02,861
If somebody killed Benji,
it had to be for his truck.

228
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:03,845
Tricked-out '59 El Camino.

229
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,046
SWEETS:
You think someone

230
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:06,264
would kill for a pickup truck?

231
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:07,432
I'll tell
you who hated

232
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:08,666
that truck.
Courtney.

233
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:09,717
SWEETS:
Who's Courtney?

234
00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:11,686
His ex-girlfriend.

235
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,105
They broke up
a week ago.

236
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:24,265
WELLS:
Okay, given the choice,

237
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,701
would you rather have your brain
in a beetle's body

238
00:09:26,735 --> 00:09:29,204
or a beetle's brain
in your body?

239
00:09:29,238 --> 00:09:30,872
Okay, all right,
I'll bite.

240
00:09:30,906 --> 00:09:33,208
If my brain were
in a beetle's body,

241
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:34,959
then I would be King
of the Beetles,

242
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,544
just like I'm King
of the Lab.

243
00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:38,296
There, what does
that answer tell you?

244
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:41,416
It tells me you not only feel
like you belong here,

245
00:09:41,434 --> 00:09:43,468
but that this
is your domain

246
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,854
and you love it.
You're a very happy man.

247
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:47,922
Ah, I can't argue
with any of that.

248
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,024
Contusion on the occipital bone,

249
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:52,193
roughly 20 millimeters
in diameter.

250
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:54,595
Staining suggests that
the trauma occurred

251
00:09:54,613 --> 00:09:56,698
around the time of death.

252
00:09:56,732 --> 00:10:00,235
Dr. Brennan prefers we use terms
like "conked on the noggin."

253
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:03,488
The beetle question also told me
that you're mischievous

254
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:05,206
and disruptive
by spirit

255
00:10:05,241 --> 00:10:07,826
and willing to lie
for humorous effect.

256
00:10:07,877 --> 00:10:10,879
That conk wasn't enough to kill.

257
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:13,748
What else did
that beetle question tell you?

258
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:16,835
You got picked on a lot
in high school, didn't you?

259
00:10:18,554 --> 00:10:20,955
I didn't kill Benji.

260
00:10:20,973 --> 00:10:24,008
Uh, that man was
the love of my life.

261
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:26,594
So it was Benji
who broke up with you?

262
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:28,430
Seriously?

263
00:10:28,464 --> 00:10:30,098
Look at me.

264
00:10:30,132 --> 00:10:31,516
I am the one who dumped him.

265
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,935
I thought you said
he was the love of your life.

266
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:36,905
Yeah. Too bad it wasn't
a reciprocal relationship.

267
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:38,806
Oh, right.
So there was another woman.

268
00:10:38,824 --> 00:10:40,558
Again, please,

269
00:10:40,593 --> 00:10:43,278
look at me. You really think
that Benji could get a woman

270
00:10:43,312 --> 00:10:44,979
hotter than me? I mean...
(scoffs)

271
00:10:44,997 --> 00:10:46,448
I couldn't compete

272
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:47,365
with his truck though.

273
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,700
Ever since he saw
that old photo

274
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:50,535
of his dad posing
with an El Camino,

275
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:53,588
he decided that he needed
to restore one just like it.

276
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:55,557
So, what did he do
the rest of the time?

277
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:58,810
His experiments,
which I did not resent.

278
00:10:58,861 --> 00:10:59,944
Why?

279
00:10:59,979 --> 00:11:01,896
They were
scientific experiments.

280
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,281
Benji was...

281
00:11:03,315 --> 00:11:04,949
(sighs)
wicked smart.

282
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:07,285
Except when it came
to the stupid truck.

283
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:08,570
I know some scientists,

284
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:11,823
and they are specific
about their branch of science.

285
00:11:11,874 --> 00:11:13,441
Time travel.

286
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:15,994
What?
SWEETS: Benji was into...

287
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:18,980
time travel? Not time-share,

288
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:20,832
like condos,
but traveling...

289
00:11:20,883 --> 00:11:22,050
through time?

290
00:11:22,084 --> 00:11:24,853
Yeah. He wanted to be
the first to do it.

291
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:26,521
Okay, so...
Benji wanted

292
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:27,955
to be a time traveler,
but you were

293
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:29,224
mad at him because of a truck?

294
00:11:29,258 --> 00:11:30,225
Duh.

295
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,809
One was gonna make us
a lot of money,

296
00:11:31,844 --> 00:11:33,478
the other was just a stupid truck.
And when was

297
00:11:33,512 --> 00:11:35,013
the last time
you talked to Benji?

298
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:36,681
Last Saturday night.

299
00:11:36,732 --> 00:11:37,849
We argued.

300
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,017
About the truck?

301
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:40,568
Courtney, that
was the night

302
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:41,603
that he was killed.

303
00:11:41,637 --> 00:11:42,770
Did he say anything that could

304
00:11:42,804 --> 00:11:43,738
lead to his killer?

305
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:46,357
He said he was too busy.

306
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:48,076
With his truck.
Of course.

307
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,245
His truck.

308
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,281
Would you choose
a truck over this?

309
00:11:58,254 --> 00:12:00,004
Okay, seriously,

310
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,839
but is she crazy enough
to kill someone?

311
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:03,675
SWEETS:
She seems to display some of

312
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:05,660
the symptoms of Intermittent
Explosive Disorder.

313
00:12:05,678 --> 00:12:06,961
What does that mean,
she gets mad?

314
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:08,346
I.E.D. is usually
characterized

315
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,666
by sporadic episodes
of extreme aggression,

316
00:12:11,684 --> 00:12:13,885
violence and
destructive behavior.

317
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:15,553
Sweets, could she kill him?

318
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:18,973
If she was at the mercy
of her own anger, yeah.

319
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:21,392
Yeah.

320
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,639
What are you eating, Dr. Wells?

321
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:35,140
String cheese.

322
00:12:35,174 --> 00:12:36,558
Do you want
some string cheese?

323
00:12:36,592 --> 00:12:38,593
Eating in the lab
is strictly prohibited.

324
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:39,978
Whenever I'm working
on a conundrum,

325
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:41,313
I always eat string cheese.

326
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,042
It started when I was
in grade school

327
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:44,180
and I was getting ready
for the science fair.

328
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,065
Which I won.
I don't care.

329
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,900
Thought-controlled
prosthetic limbs

330
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:50,236
and the elimination
of artifact distraction

331
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,571
from E.E.G. signal processing.

332
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,806
I'm pretty sure
you care about that.

333
00:12:53,824 --> 00:12:55,358
I was 13 years old.

334
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:58,027
We are concerned
with these bones, now.

335
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,862
Nothing more.
Right.

336
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:03,249
The, uh, cheese made me
think of calcium,

337
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,085
which is important for bone
growth, and that brought

338
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,587
my attention to the scoliosis

339
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,089
from which the victim suffered.

340
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,708
I also found incomplete
perimortem fractures

341
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,095
to the right anterolateral
tibia and fibula.

342
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,464
You got to admit,

343
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,433
I'm pretty impressive.

344
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,184
Until recently
on the isle of Vanuatu,

345
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,469
you could be cannibalized

346
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,187
for disobeying
your tribal chief.

347
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,223
And you could have been forced
to give your child

348
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,692
to my clan to settle
this petty conflict.

349
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,510
You're familiar
with the Vanuatu?

350
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:33,528
My knowledge is vast.
Which is why I'm here, right?

351
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,449
So, don't try to cherry-pick
facts to win an argument.

352
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,851
Then let's deal with our tribe.

353
00:13:38,869 --> 00:13:40,903
You have not yet
found cause of death.

354
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,623
Finish rearticulating
these bones as ordered

355
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:46,242
or you will be banished.

356
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,550
Double mocha latte.

357
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,368
Oh, God's perfect food.

358
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:57,470
I thought that was pizza.

359
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,172
Well, you need something
to wash it down with.

360
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,541
Did you find anything
in Benji's clothes?

361
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,211
Well, a couple of strawberry
seeds in his shoe tread.

362
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:07,880
Were there any strawberries
on the farm

363
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:09,214
where he was buried?
No,

364
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:11,073
but they are grown
pretty much everywhere else.

365
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,151
So it doesn't help much

366
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,385
in determining
what he was doing

367
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:14,603
on the night
of his death.

368
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:15,771
Well, how about you?

369
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:16,989
Well, Courtney's alibi
checked out.

370
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,992
She was hating on a DJ
at a club.

371
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,912
So, I looked into Benji's
hard drive.

372
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,448
It's filled
with headache-inducing

373
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:27,700
theories on time travel.

374
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,368
Awesome.

375
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,920
Wow.

376
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,171
Time dilation.

377
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,840
Relativistic velocities.

378
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,742
This kid was pretty smart.

379
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,745
He was trying
to go back, not forward.

380
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:41,013
What difference
does that make?

381
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,581
I mean, this
is all crazy.

382
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,083
Not really.
See, Einstein tells us

383
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:47,136
that traveling into the future
is theoretically possible,

384
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:50,806
but visiting the past,
now that gets into causality

385
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,441
and everything
starts falling apart.

386
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,694
Do you think he really thought
that he could do it?

387
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,562
Oh, man, wouldn't you want to?

388
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:59,815
I would go back
to April 19, 2004.

389
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,650
The moment I first met you.

390
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:04,954
You had a rubber band
on your wrist,

391
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,622
and a spider on your shoulder.

392
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,440
(laughs)
That's right. What about you?

393
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,743
If you could go back,
what moment would you choose?

394
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,129
I would choose that one.

395
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,947
I would choose that...

396
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:16,716
I would choose that same moment.

397
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,167
You had to take a minute
to think about that.

398
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,168
Are you sure?

399
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,620
Yes, I am... I'm sure.

400
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:24,390
Give me this.

401
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,175
One other thing that I found.

402
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,144
Benji was spending
a lot of time

403
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:30,229
on the Collindale
University server.

404
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,149
Which is very weird, because
he wasn't a student there.

405
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:35,985
He was logged in as

406
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,353
Professor Scott Hunter.

407
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,972
Hunter. He's a
theoretical physicist.

408
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,525
You know, a lot of Benji's math
was pretty sophisticated.

409
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:44,160
I wonder if they were
working together on that.

410
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,310
On time travel?

411
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:46,512
Yeah, theoretical physicists

412
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:47,780
can be pretty weird.

413
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,865
I'll tell Booth
to look into Hunter.

414
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,986
You sure you didn't want to go
back to some other time?

415
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,122
Nope.

416
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,790
That time.

417
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:00,659
Yeah, okay.

418
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:02,161
(chuckles)
Okay.

419
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,853
SWEETS: <i>People become obsessed</i>
<i>with time travel</i>

420
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,522
either because they're missing
something or they're running

421
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:14,557
away from something.

422
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:15,441
Well, according to his brother,

423
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,842
Benji had a pretty
rough childhood.

424
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,228
I mean, come on, why would
anyone want to revisit that?

425
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,148
Because that's
where he felt that he lost

426
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,449
a part of himself.

427
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,184
I think he wanted
to go back

428
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:26,869
to stop his dad from leaving.

429
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,021
What, he was trying to save his
family from falling apart?

430
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,522
Yes. Exactly.

431
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,159
Look, everyone at some point

432
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,526
has wanted to go back.

433
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:37,329
I... I wish I could,

434
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,298
to see the Finleys again.

435
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,383
The couple
that adopted me.

436
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,086
They saved my life, and I was...

437
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:47,206
a kid, I...

438
00:16:47,224 --> 00:16:49,225
I gave them a rough time,
I don't know.

439
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,344
I just wish I could go back
and let them know

440
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,930
how much I appreciate them.

441
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:57,766
They know.

442
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,604
Um, you said
you found something?

443
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,055
Yeah.

444
00:17:03,073 --> 00:17:04,323
This guy, uh,
Professor Hunter,

445
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,324
might be someone else

446
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,611
who's looking for a do-over.

447
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,165
Taught physics at Collindale

448
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,834
till two years ago,
when he was fired

449
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,452
for electrocuting a student.
He was also

450
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:18,687
supposed to meet Benji
the night he was killed.

451
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,175
WELLS:
<i>Dr. Brennan, given the choice,</i>

452
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,409
would you rather be run over

453
00:17:24,427 --> 00:17:27,263
by one steamroller
or by 1,000 mopeds?

454
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,966
Why would you ask
such a preposterous question?

455
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,685
Dr. George did
psychological experiments

456
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,137
at Cambridge on bias
and judgment formation....

457
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,472
I don't like psychology.

458
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,757
And I'm not the one
we're studying here.

459
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:41,360
Sorry.

460
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,195
Would that be one moped

461
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,596
1,000 times,

462
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:45,814
or 1,000 mopeds at once?

463
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:46,815
It doesn't matter.

464
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:48,027
You'd choose the steamroller.

465
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,768
By the time it had
run over your legs,

466
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:50,953
you'd already
be dead from shock.

467
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,038
It fits in with your
hyper-rational outlook.

468
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,658
Please don't pretend
to know how my mind works.

469
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:57,442
You shy away from randomness,

470
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,996
and that prevents you
from casting a wide net.

471
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:05,617
Are you saying
that I'm narrow-minded?

472
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:07,953
Your words, not mine.

473
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:09,755
That's interesting.
There appears to be

474
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,173
microfracturing

475
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,509
to the anterior
and posterior aspects

476
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,427
of right sternal ribs
nine and ten.

477
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,513
As well as the anterior aspect

478
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:19,515
of the right

479
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,466
vertebral ribs 11 and 12.

480
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:23,569
So whatever created
this damage also created

481
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,804
some pretty horrific damage
to the liver as well.

482
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:28,023
Which would have certainly
caused his death.

483
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,909
Didn't Agent Booth
say that the professor

484
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:33,195
that Benji was working with
once electrocuted a student?

485
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,663
If a current passed through

486
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,832
the thoracic region
with enough voltage,

487
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,535
it could certainly
have created

488
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,203
the fracturing on the bone.

489
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:45,207
No wide net needed.

490
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:51,630
BRENNAN:
<i>Professor Hunter got fired</i>

491
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,498
<i>for electrocuting a student.</i>

492
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:56,268
Losing university resources
could drive Hunter

493
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,670
to start working
with outsiders such as Benji.

494
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:00,055
Experiment that goes wrong,

495
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:01,673
Benji gets electrocuted.

496
00:19:01,691 --> 00:19:03,108
And knowing that he
could be convicted

497
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,509
of negligent homicide,

498
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:07,112
Hunter decides to,
what, dump the body.

499
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,615
You're casting a wide net.

500
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:10,899
Huh?

501
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,785
By positing various motives.

502
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,286
I don't do that, apparently.

503
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,455
Rather be run over
by a steamroller.

504
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,539
What?

505
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,124
You want to be run
over by a steamroller?

506
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,192
Yes.

507
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,379
Instead of a thousand
mopeds, of course.

508
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,414
I'm-I'm... what am I
hearing right now?

509
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,632
Am I having a stroke?

510
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,800
Dr. Wells

511
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,668
defined me, with ease.

512
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,136
I don't like that.

513
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,338
Even if he's correct.

514
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,423
I'd love to help
you here, Bones,

515
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,891
but I really
have absolutely

516
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,643
no idea what you're
talking about.

517
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,927
It's fine, Booth.

518
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:41,263
Maybe Dr. Wells is right.

519
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,882
Maybe I'm narrow-minded.

520
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,101
(mouths)

521
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,605
No.

522
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:50,939
No. What?

523
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,527
BRENNAN: Odd for a professor
of theoretical physics

524
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,613
to be working with someone
without a degree.

525
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,398
Benjamin read an
article I had written.

526
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,166
He knew I was
conducting experiments

527
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,835
in time travel and
wanted to help.

528
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,753
So, what, he just show up
at your doorstep one day?

529
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,071
Basically, yes.

530
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:07,289
It was about a year ago.

531
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,907
We've been working
together ever since.

532
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:10,509
Including the night
that he died.

533
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,511
We've pinpointed time of death.

534
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,413
You think <i>I</i> killed Benjamin?

535
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:15,881
Well, I mean,
accidents do happen,

536
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,950
but you know that all too well,
now, don't you, Professor?

537
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:20,085
This is ludicrous.
You can't be serious.

538
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,121
Sometimes these accidents
are just so big,

539
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,156
you just try to cover them up,
isn't that right?

540
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:26,341
We need to see
your lab, Professor.

541
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:28,711
HUNTER:
At-at least put on a gown.

542
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:31,764
You're contaminating
the entire facility.

543
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:32,931
Please, Dr. Brennan,

544
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:34,833
from one scientist
to another.

545
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:36,501
That's for my
metamaterial experiment.

546
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,603
Please don't touch that.

547
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,521
Whoa.
BOOTH: Oh. Exposed wiring.

548
00:20:39,556 --> 00:20:40,773
You seem to make a habit

549
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,441
out of being
negligent, Professor.

550
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,842
BRENNAN:
This is a

551
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,510
240-volt battery.

552
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:46,779
If Benji came into contact

553
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,364
with these wires,
it could have

554
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:50,616
created the fracturing

555
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,534
we found on his ribs.

556
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:54,019
(electricity crackles)

557
00:21:02,288 --> 00:21:03,788
Professor was cooking with some

558
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,952
serious fire
with these batteries.

559
00:21:05,954 --> 00:21:08,222
240 volts to the chest
could definitely be responsible

560
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:10,241
for Benji's death,
but was it enough

561
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:11,509
to crack his ribs?

562
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,161
Well, that's what we're
here to find out,

563
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,560
my brother from another mother.

564
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:16,763
See, this ordnance gel
has been calibrated

565
00:21:16,814 --> 00:21:18,432
to absolutely replicate

566
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:21,384
human tissue, so we can see
if the ribs crack

567
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:22,819
when they're electrocuted.

568
00:21:22,854 --> 00:21:24,688
You certainly
love your job, huh?

569
00:21:24,722 --> 00:21:26,490
See, I always get
bored so easily,

570
00:21:26,524 --> 00:21:28,725
which is why keep accumulating
all these degrees.

571
00:21:28,743 --> 00:21:29,776
Which explains your hope

572
00:21:29,827 --> 00:21:30,944
that time travel exists,

573
00:21:30,995 --> 00:21:32,529
because that would
not be boring.

574
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:33,864
Yeah, well,

575
00:21:33,898 --> 00:21:35,449
I would not go back, though.

576
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,734
I'd keep my past
in the past.

577
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:39,336
Whoa, it's like
you're hiding something.

578
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,671
No, it's just,
what's done is done.

579
00:21:41,706 --> 00:21:45,074
There's so much more money
to be made in the future.

580
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:46,075
I wouldn't go that far forward.

581
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:47,344
Just, like, five years.

582
00:21:47,378 --> 00:21:48,595
Vernor Vinge's

583
00:21:48,629 --> 00:21:51,748
theory of exponential
accelerating change, huh?

584
00:21:51,766 --> 00:21:54,083
Exactly, and that
pretty much guarantees

585
00:21:54,102 --> 00:21:56,720
some pretty sweet
technological advances.

586
00:21:56,754 --> 00:21:58,638
So, you would travel
to the future,

587
00:21:58,689 --> 00:22:00,857
steal their technology,

588
00:22:00,892 --> 00:22:02,425
then bring it back here

589
00:22:02,443 --> 00:22:04,861
to the present
and make a fortune?

590
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:07,030
Well, there's no legal precedent
for time travel,

591
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:09,282
so I wouldn't exactly
say I was stealing.

592
00:22:09,317 --> 00:22:10,817
Well, being
that we are

593
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:12,268
evidence-based here,
I think you should

594
00:22:12,286 --> 00:22:13,770
keep that one to yourself.

595
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:15,155
Okay. Ready?

596
00:22:15,206 --> 00:22:16,823
Yeah.

597
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:19,493
Zip up.

598
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:22,913
Put this on.

599
00:22:22,947 --> 00:22:24,948
Thank you.

600
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:28,802
Okay.

601
00:22:28,836 --> 00:22:30,253
Ready?

602
00:22:30,287 --> 00:22:31,788
Fire in the hole!

603
00:22:31,806 --> 00:22:34,925
Technically, it's not a fire
until the amps make sure the...

604
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,130
WELLS:
Maybe, uh,

605
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:42,766
next time, protective
eyewear, I think?

606
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,984
Yeah.
Yeah. Maybe?

607
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:46,186
Fair enough.
(clears throat)

608
00:22:49,857 --> 00:22:52,192
Wow. We just hit this
guy with enough current

609
00:22:52,243 --> 00:22:53,910
to take down an elephant.

610
00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:56,279
Still no fracturing of the ribs.
Yeah.

611
00:22:56,313 --> 00:22:59,316
Meaning that Benji was not
killed by electrocution.

612
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,651
WELLS: Thought. Have
you considered

613
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:03,787
hydrostatic shock?

614
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:08,157
You're talking about doing
another experiment, aren't you?

615
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:12,846
Perhaps I am your brother
from another mother.

616
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,733
(laughs)

617
00:23:17,618 --> 00:23:20,320
So, the professor said
that there was a call made

618
00:23:20,354 --> 00:23:22,389
to Benji's cell phone
on Saturday night,

619
00:23:22,423 --> 00:23:23,690
and there was, but

620
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:26,026
the caller used a
disposable cell.

621
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,879
Benji was at the professor's
place in Silver Spring

622
00:23:28,913 --> 00:23:30,180
when he got the call.

623
00:23:30,214 --> 00:23:31,514
The FBI

624
00:23:31,532 --> 00:23:34,401
said the victim borrowed cash
from Professor Hunter,

625
00:23:34,452 --> 00:23:36,870
<i>and</i> withdrew cash
from two ATMs.

626
00:23:36,904 --> 00:23:38,989
One here,

627
00:23:39,023 --> 00:23:42,492
and the second here,

628
00:23:42,526 --> 00:23:44,327
farther outside the city.

629
00:23:44,361 --> 00:23:47,681
So, Benji was leaving town,
and collecting money as he went.

630
00:23:47,715 --> 00:23:51,334
The body was
found here

631
00:23:51,368 --> 00:23:53,420
in Brookmont.

632
00:23:53,454 --> 00:23:58,208
So, why was Benji at an ATM
up in North Bethesda?

633
00:23:58,242 --> 00:24:00,677
Cam,

634
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:04,064
if time travel existed,
and you could make one trip,

635
00:24:04,098 --> 00:24:05,882
what would it be?

636
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,935
You mean, like,
have tea with Jesus,

637
00:24:08,986 --> 00:24:11,054
or strangle Hitler
in his crib?

638
00:24:11,072 --> 00:24:12,989
Or redo something
from your own life

639
00:24:13,024 --> 00:24:14,691
when you were happiest.

640
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,780
(laughs):
What is it?

641
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:22,449
I can't.

642
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,867
Oh, come on!

643
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:29,539
Do you remember your ex-husband?

644
00:24:29,573 --> 00:24:32,175
Oh, my God! Birimbau?

645
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:33,843
I am sorry.

646
00:24:33,878 --> 00:24:35,578
I would do the
same thing.

647
00:24:35,596 --> 00:24:37,964
The same guy, I mean.

648
00:24:38,015 --> 00:24:39,349
Oh, my God.

649
00:24:39,383 --> 00:24:41,968
Would you tell your
significant other the truth,

650
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:43,270
or would you...?

651
00:24:43,304 --> 00:24:45,021
Oh, I would tell him that...

652
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,573
I wanted to have tea with Jesus.

653
00:24:46,624 --> 00:24:47,857
Oh.

654
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,025
Excuse me?

655
00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:51,527
Hi.

656
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:56,666
I ran a spectroscopic analysis
of the strawberry seeds and soil

657
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,035
found in the sole
of Benji's shoe. Could you...?

658
00:24:59,053 --> 00:25:02,205
Yes, yes.

659
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,574
Now, the shoe soil is
very <i>deficient</i> in calcium.

660
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:07,844
But his body was found in soil
extremely <i>rich</i> in calcium.

661
00:25:07,878 --> 00:25:10,363
So, the body was moved
after he was killed?

662
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:12,599
Yeah, he was killed
in serpentine soil.

663
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:16,052
It's very rare, but there are
some deposits here in Rockville.

664
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,771
That is a

665
00:25:17,822 --> 00:25:19,689
strawberry farm <i>near</i> Rockville.

666
00:25:19,723 --> 00:25:21,908
Tell Booth.
HODGINS: Cam,

667
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:25,228
I actually came in here
to ask you for a gun.

668
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:30,033
Okay.

669
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:33,736
HODGINS:
I wanted to shoot the gun.

670
00:25:33,754 --> 00:25:36,572
Well, I am the one
<i>authorized</i> to shoot the gun.

671
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,241
My only question is, why?

672
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:40,410
The microfracturing on
the victim's ribs did not occur

673
00:25:40,428 --> 00:25:42,178
due to electrical shock,

674
00:25:42,213 --> 00:25:45,415
but the waves in the gel made me
think of hydrostatic shock.

675
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:48,301
See, the high rate of speed at
which a bullet enters the body

676
00:25:48,352 --> 00:25:50,186
causes displacement in
the liquids surrounding it.

677
00:25:50,221 --> 00:25:51,805
So we believe that if the victim

678
00:25:51,856 --> 00:25:53,589
was shot just below
the rib cage,

679
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:56,943
this expansion could have
created the microfracturing.

680
00:25:56,977 --> 00:25:59,095
Okay.

681
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,534
Fire in the hole!

682
00:26:04,568 --> 00:26:06,102
That's my...

683
00:26:08,656 --> 00:26:10,773
That's my line.

684
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:13,910
Ah.

685
00:26:13,944 --> 00:26:15,095
It worked.

686
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:16,579
SAROYAN:
The victim was shot.

687
00:26:16,613 --> 00:26:19,332
Wow. It is good to have

688
00:26:19,383 --> 00:26:20,616
a physicist
in the house.

689
00:26:20,634 --> 00:26:21,784
What?

690
00:26:21,802 --> 00:26:24,337
I... It's...

691
00:26:27,475 --> 00:26:29,625
(crickets chirping)

692
00:26:43,074 --> 00:26:45,742
BRENNAN: The house
is completely boarded up.

693
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:48,695
Doesn't look like anyone's
lived here for quite some time.

694
00:26:48,746 --> 00:26:50,330
Really? Then why is there
a light on in the barn?

695
00:26:50,364 --> 00:26:52,482
All right, enough.
Can you keep that down?

696
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,452
Oh, easy. Easy, easy.

697
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,491
Yeah. Looks like
someone broke in.

698
00:27:04,678 --> 00:27:08,381
Well, looks like
Benji's truck.

699
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:11,468
I think it's more
of a car, to be honest with you.

700
00:27:12,853 --> 00:27:15,054
Booth?
Yeah.

701
00:27:19,443 --> 00:27:21,778
BOOTH: That's a lot of blood
for one person.

702
00:27:21,812 --> 00:27:24,531
Benji may have
also been killed here.

703
00:27:24,565 --> 00:27:27,200
Rugged nuchal area
on the cranium,

704
00:27:27,234 --> 00:27:29,285
as well
as the convoluted sutures,

705
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,021
suggest the victim
was an Hispanic male.

706
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,189
Like Benji.

707
00:27:34,408 --> 00:27:36,376
Victim appears
to have suffered

708
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,913
projectile trauma to the
inferior right thoracic region.

709
00:27:39,964 --> 00:27:41,664
Like Benji.

710
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,035
Texturing of the
sternal rib ends

711
00:27:46,053 --> 00:27:50,340
indicates an age
of mid-to-late 40s

712
00:27:50,374 --> 00:27:53,476
Bones, I mean,
you're describing Benji,

713
00:27:53,511 --> 00:27:56,546
but 20 years older.

714
00:28:04,427 --> 00:28:07,739
The victim suffered a
single gunshot wound

715
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:10,336
to the inferior right
thoracic region.

716
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,004
Huh.

717
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:15,140
And judging by the marbling
and skin slippage,

718
00:28:15,175 --> 00:28:18,177
I'd say he's been dead
about six days?

719
00:28:18,211 --> 00:28:19,445
Double huh.

720
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:21,764
I'm sorry.
Why the double huh, Dr. Wells?

721
00:28:21,815 --> 00:28:23,098
Because

722
00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:27,552
I believe that our two victims
may be the same person.

723
00:28:28,572 --> 00:28:30,239
Excuse me?
WELLS: Quantum physics

724
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:31,890
tells us
that out there somewhere

725
00:28:31,908 --> 00:28:34,860
is a world 20 years
ahead of this one, right?

726
00:28:35,795 --> 00:28:37,162
Theoretically.

727
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:39,365
Now, assuming that Benji

728
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:41,617
is a time traveler
from the future...

729
00:28:41,668 --> 00:28:42,484
Big assumption.

730
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,203
<i>Big</i> assumption.

731
00:28:44,237 --> 00:28:45,838
When he transports himself
back here,

732
00:28:45,872 --> 00:28:49,408
he changes the course
of his destiny in <i>this</i> time.

733
00:28:49,426 --> 00:28:51,210
So, when younger Benji

734
00:28:51,244 --> 00:28:53,212
gets shot, future Benji

735
00:28:53,246 --> 00:28:55,014
must then take a bullet

736
00:28:55,048 --> 00:28:57,433
to satisfy the variable
of causality.

737
00:28:57,467 --> 00:28:59,101
Is this necessary?

738
00:28:59,135 --> 00:29:01,387
You said that you believe
time travel is impossible.

739
00:29:01,421 --> 00:29:02,454
Just because

740
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:04,640
something is
theoretically impossible

741
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:06,825
doesn't mean
that it's not possible.

742
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,894
I believe
that is exactly what it means.

743
00:29:08,928 --> 00:29:11,563
Well, of course you do,
because your mind stops working

744
00:29:11,597 --> 00:29:13,232
when it hears
the word impossible,

745
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:15,901
where mine just keeps going
and exploring.

746
00:29:15,935 --> 00:29:18,237
If you believe that the
two victims are the same person,

747
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:19,571
you don't belong in this lab.

748
00:29:19,605 --> 00:29:21,874
Of course I don't believe that.
That's absurd.

749
00:29:21,908 --> 00:29:23,075
Excellent. Moving on.

750
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:25,244
But I do <i>embrace</i>

751
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:28,464
the impossible probability
as a reality.

752
00:29:28,498 --> 00:29:31,583
I mean, what serious
scientist wouldn't?

753
00:29:33,053 --> 00:29:34,453
I found a contusion

754
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:35,787
on the frontal bone,

755
00:29:35,805 --> 00:29:39,091
roughly 20 millimeters
in diameter.

756
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,476
Which suggests
this man was struck

757
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,227
on the head around
time of death.

758
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:45,630
Just like... our first victim.

759
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:50,185
I believe
that warrants a triple <i>huh.</i>

760
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,841
BOOTH:
<i>This guy-- he is a jackass.</i>

761
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:58,110
Okay? He's gonna be gone
when this case is over.

762
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,029
Maybe Dr. Wells has a point, though.
(scoffs)

763
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,831
Just because we can't travel
through time right now

764
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:05,367
doesn't mean that we
can't do it in the future.

765
00:30:05,418 --> 00:30:08,837
Okay, well, then, why aren't
these future-seeing people here,

766
00:30:08,872 --> 00:30:10,422
and they're not
rewriting the past,

767
00:30:10,457 --> 00:30:11,957
or betting
on football games then?

768
00:30:11,991 --> 00:30:13,709
Okay, I don't have
all the answers.

769
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,761
I'm just trying to
cast a wider net.

770
00:30:15,795 --> 00:30:17,379
Okay, well, here's
where I'm casting mine.

771
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,598
So, these guys--
they met at a remote place.

772
00:30:19,632 --> 00:30:21,550
There were burner cells
that were involved.

773
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:24,002
There was cash
that we never found.

774
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,772
Suggesting an illegal
transaction that ends in death.

775
00:30:26,806 --> 00:30:28,974
But the only thing
I don't understand is,

776
00:30:29,008 --> 00:30:31,176
why the killer took Benji's body
and buried it in another farm.

777
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:34,196
Well, clearly,
we need a wider net.

778
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,181
Hmm. This guy Wells--

779
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:38,350
did he mention anything
about the asteroid mining?

780
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:40,102
(sighs)

781
00:30:40,136 --> 00:30:41,520
What?
Booth.

782
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:42,571
I'm just curious.
(phone ringing)

783
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:44,156
Really?
Yeah.

784
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,191
Brennan.

785
00:30:46,209 --> 00:30:48,077
Sorry to interrupt your lunch,

786
00:30:48,128 --> 00:30:50,996
but I found something on the
second victim's right patella.

787
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,748
Oh, a comminuted fracture.

788
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,384
Right. I placed the bone
under a microscope,

789
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:57,386
and at 40 times
magnification,

790
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,922
I found evidence
of slight remodeling.

791
00:30:59,973 --> 00:31:01,757
So, he was probably
walking or limping

792
00:31:01,808 --> 00:31:03,542
on this injury
for several few days.

793
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,643
That is a severe break.

794
00:31:04,677 --> 00:31:06,478
The man must have been
in immense pain.

795
00:31:06,513 --> 00:31:08,480
Right. Yet, instead
of going to a hospital,

796
00:31:08,515 --> 00:31:10,149
he was hanging out in a barn?

797
00:31:10,183 --> 00:31:12,024
See, I'm thinking,
he didn't go to the hospital

798
00:31:12,051 --> 00:31:13,819
because he couldn't.

799
00:31:13,853 --> 00:31:15,571
He couldn't jeopardize
anybody knowing

800
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:18,273
that he was from the future.

801
00:31:19,826 --> 00:31:22,745
Or perhaps there is
a more logical explanation.

802
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:25,897
The victim suffered
from a minor case of scoliosis.

803
00:31:25,915 --> 00:31:27,666
Just like Benji.

804
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,702
Right. And Scoliosis is
a hereditary disease,

805
00:31:30,736 --> 00:31:35,124
which suggests that both
victims might be related.

806
00:31:35,175 --> 00:31:36,759
Sorry to disappoint you,
Dr. Wells.

807
00:31:36,793 --> 00:31:41,180
DNA results confirm that our
second victim is Benji's father.

808
00:31:43,383 --> 00:31:46,135
Sounds reasonable.

809
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:54,493
GARCIA: <i>First you tell me</i>
<i>my little brother's dead.</i>

810
00:31:54,527 --> 00:31:56,862
Now you're telling me
my father's dead, too?

811
00:31:56,896 --> 00:31:59,398
I'm sorry for your loss.

812
00:31:59,432 --> 00:32:01,433
Yeah.

813
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:03,569
Thanks.

814
00:32:05,438 --> 00:32:07,356
I can't believe this.

815
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:10,042
You told Agent Booth
that your father left

816
00:32:10,076 --> 00:32:12,077
when you and Benji were young.

817
00:32:12,111 --> 00:32:14,079
Were you aware that, um,

818
00:32:14,113 --> 00:32:15,731
Benji's been in contact
with your dad?

819
00:32:15,765 --> 00:32:18,617
No. Benji would have told me.

820
00:32:18,635 --> 00:32:21,753
It must have been
a one-time thing.

821
00:32:21,787 --> 00:32:23,505
How can you be so sure of that?

822
00:32:23,556 --> 00:32:25,924
'Cause Benji thought
our dad was dead.

823
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:28,010
Why would he think that?

824
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:30,229
Benji was little
when Felix left.

825
00:32:30,263 --> 00:32:33,965
Rather than tell him
his dad was a deadbeat junkie,

826
00:32:33,983 --> 00:32:37,402
Mom and I decided
to tell him that Felix was dead.

827
00:32:37,437 --> 00:32:39,071
When was the last time
you saw your father?

828
00:32:39,105 --> 00:32:40,856
Years ago.

829
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:42,157
And that was fine with me.

830
00:32:42,192 --> 00:32:44,409
Now, if your father
was still an addict,

831
00:32:44,444 --> 00:32:46,245
do you think
that could explain why

832
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:48,614
he reached out to Benji
last Saturday night?

833
00:32:48,648 --> 00:32:50,415
Had to be.

834
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,668
That son of a bitch
was probably in trouble

835
00:32:52,702 --> 00:32:54,336
with one of his dealers.

836
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:57,089
He needed Benji
to bail him out.

837
00:32:57,123 --> 00:32:59,691
WELLS:
<i>The bullet that entered Felix</i>

838
00:32:59,726 --> 00:33:01,577
nicked the sternal end
of the inferior tenth,

839
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:03,545
and then, went on
to lodge itself

840
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,247
into the superior margin
of the 11th rib.

841
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:07,466
There could be two shooters.

842
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,135
Or the victims were
on the ground,

843
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:12,938
and the killer just
stood over them and shot.

844
00:33:12,972 --> 00:33:15,641
Which would also explain the
damage to both of their skulls.

845
00:33:15,675 --> 00:33:17,809
This is a pretty
easy explanation. Sorry.

846
00:33:17,843 --> 00:33:20,479
I realize that you might
think that I'm crazy

847
00:33:20,513 --> 00:33:21,446
like Yoshiro Nakamatsu

848
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:23,732
or Tycho Brahe,
but without them,

849
00:33:23,783 --> 00:33:25,951
we wouldn't have the laws
of planetary motion

850
00:33:25,985 --> 00:33:27,753
or the simple taxi meter.

851
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:31,456
(sighs) It's not crazy that I'm worried
about, actually.

852
00:33:31,491 --> 00:33:32,991
It's arrogance.

853
00:33:33,025 --> 00:33:35,244
We're a team here,
and you can be traded.

854
00:33:35,295 --> 00:33:37,462
Wherever I go I'm always
the smartest person,

855
00:33:37,497 --> 00:33:38,780
and it always creates problems.

856
00:33:38,815 --> 00:33:41,917
Well, maybe you should try
being less of a douche.

857
00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:44,836
Could you please rotate
both sets of remains

858
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:48,090
90 degrees to the left?
Yes.

859
00:33:48,141 --> 00:33:49,758
But you can't.

860
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:51,977
Hmm. Well,

861
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:54,263
you were wrong
about the skull damage.

862
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:55,564
They were both hit

863
00:33:55,598 --> 00:33:58,350
with the other's head.

864
00:33:58,384 --> 00:34:00,602
Oh, my God.

865
00:34:00,637 --> 00:34:02,654
I really hate to
say this, but

866
00:34:02,689 --> 00:34:04,039
you are actually right.

867
00:34:04,073 --> 00:34:05,357
In this position, the trajectory

868
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:07,426
of both bullet wounds now...

869
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,527
lines up.

870
00:34:08,561 --> 00:34:11,013
It does. Perfect.

871
00:34:11,047 --> 00:34:13,198
Do I look humble?

872
00:34:13,232 --> 00:34:15,617
I'm trying to be less
of a douche.

873
00:34:21,674 --> 00:34:24,509
BOOTH:
<i>Ford's Theatre, 1865. Yep.</i>

874
00:34:24,544 --> 00:34:26,345
But you said that time travel
was impossible.

875
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:28,797
It is impossible.
I'm saying if it isn't, okay?

876
00:34:28,848 --> 00:34:30,465
Then, like, a movie
or something.

877
00:34:30,516 --> 00:34:33,468
You'd... stop Lincoln
from being shot?

878
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,420
Yeah, I would.
I mean, he deserved to...

879
00:34:35,438 --> 00:34:38,140
know that everything
turned out pretty well. I mean,

880
00:34:38,191 --> 00:34:40,809
I could do it. Even if it
meant that, you know, I had to

881
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,478
put a bullet in, uh,
Booth's head.

882
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:44,730
But then you might not
have been...

883
00:34:44,764 --> 00:34:46,481
Yeah, I know, Bones,
but it's impossible.

884
00:34:46,532 --> 00:34:48,533
Al right, what about you? If you
could travel through time,

885
00:34:48,568 --> 00:34:49,685
where would you go?

886
00:34:50,603 --> 00:34:52,571
I'm already there.

887
00:34:52,605 --> 00:34:53,689
Here.

888
00:34:53,723 --> 00:34:55,741
What? Here?
Here.

889
00:34:55,775 --> 00:34:58,243
The difference
between past and future

890
00:34:58,277 --> 00:35:00,945
is nowhere to be found
in the laws of physics.

891
00:35:00,964 --> 00:35:05,350
Everything I want or need
is here.

892
00:35:05,385 --> 00:35:07,502
Right now.

893
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:09,888
Wow. Right here?

894
00:35:09,922 --> 00:35:11,423
Mm-hmm.
Right now?

895
00:35:12,925 --> 00:35:15,093
(phone rings)
(groans)

896
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:19,264
Booth.

897
00:35:19,298 --> 00:35:20,349
Right.

898
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,768
Yeah, okay,
and you're sure?

899
00:35:22,802 --> 00:35:24,353
Yeah, I-I'll be right down.

900
00:35:24,404 --> 00:35:26,688
Looks like we got
Felix Garcia's drug dealer.

901
00:35:26,739 --> 00:35:30,275
According to Alex, the father
had been using for years.

902
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:31,693
He must've had
multiple dealers.

903
00:35:31,744 --> 00:35:33,978
Yeah, but here's
the kicker, okay?

904
00:35:33,997 --> 00:35:37,916
The dealer also works
at Alex's body shop.

905
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,785
So he has a connection
to both victims.

906
00:35:39,819 --> 00:35:44,155
Must not be a very good dealer
if he has to work a second job.

907
00:35:44,173 --> 00:35:45,841
Yeah, well,
killing your customer?

908
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,793
That's bad for business, too.

909
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:57,306
BOOTH: <i>So, how long have you been</i>
<i>dealing heroin, Sidney?</i>

910
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,524
I don't do that.

911
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,060
I got busted in 2009
and got off with probation.

912
00:36:01,111 --> 00:36:03,146
I took it as a sign
and I retired.

913
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,849
Right. You know what this is?
Looks like a tactical baton.

914
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:09,285
Found it in the trunk of your car.
I don't know, man.

915
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:11,154
I go to some pretty
sketchy neighborhoods.

916
00:36:11,188 --> 00:36:12,205
You use it recently?

917
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,406
Nope.

918
00:36:13,457 --> 00:36:15,958
Maybe on the kneecap
of a Felix Garcia?

919
00:36:15,993 --> 00:36:16,826
Nope.

920
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,144
Do you even know a Felix Garcia?

921
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:19,212
Nope.

922
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:20,696
No, okay. Let me
fill you in, okay?

923
00:36:20,731 --> 00:36:21,981
He owed you money
for heroin.

924
00:36:22,032 --> 00:36:23,816
He didn't pay you,
so what do you do?

925
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:26,769
You whacked him
in the kneecap with this.

926
00:36:26,787 --> 00:36:30,039
He ran and he hid, and he got
his son Benji to pay you off,

927
00:36:30,073 --> 00:36:31,774
but you shot them both.

928
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:33,743
No.

929
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:35,578
Which part?
No.

930
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:37,663
You have an alibi
for last Saturday night?

931
00:36:37,714 --> 00:36:39,282
Mm... no.

932
00:36:39,316 --> 00:36:41,050
You're gonna need a lawyer, pal.

933
00:36:41,084 --> 00:36:42,635
Why do I need a lawyer?

934
00:36:42,669 --> 00:36:45,087
I think I'm doing pretty great
on my own.

935

WELLS:
<i>The two striations</i>

936
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:49,308

937
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:50,726

with the millimeter-sized divot
at the end

939
00:36:52,846 --> 00:36:55,965
of Jouron's baton.
But if we hope to convict him,

940
00:36:55,983 --> 00:36:59,485
we need to tie his baton
to perimortem damage.

941

Benji Garcia

942

sustained this other injury
at or very near time of death.

Can you tie this to
his baton as well?

What are your thoughts
on asteroid mining, Dr. Wells?

945
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:16,819
Well, uh,
it'll definitely happen.

946
00:37:16,837 --> 00:37:19,172
Robotic technologies
have advanced to the point

947
00:37:19,206 --> 00:37:20,873
where they can be
self-repairing, and...

948
00:37:20,924 --> 00:37:24,159
near-Earth asteroids
like 4660 Nereus

949

are practical candidates for
strip and magnetic extraction.

950

Financially speaking,
the key is to invest early.

If my minor in economics
is worth anything, yes.

No striations.

00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,714
What kind of weapon

957
00:37:44,748 --> 00:37:46,348
could come down
with this kind of force

958
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:48,568
at a 45-degree angle?

959
00:37:49,536 --> 00:37:51,070
SWEETS:
<i>So, Jouron busted</i>

960
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:52,121
Felix's kneecap.

961
00:37:52,155 --> 00:37:53,539
Yeah, I mean, days
before either murder.

962
00:37:53,574 --> 00:37:56,042
Okay, so, tell me again why you
want to talk to Alex Garcia.

963
00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:58,744
When I asked him when he last
saw his father, he stood up.

964
00:37:58,795 --> 00:38:00,362
That means something.

965
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,364
Yeah, it means he's got
a cramp in his leg.

966
00:38:02,382 --> 00:38:05,534
Or it means he was fleeing
the question. Symbolically.

967
00:38:05,552 --> 00:38:07,303
If so, he's hiding
something.

968
00:38:07,337 --> 00:38:09,505
Mr. Garcia,

969
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:11,507
we got a warrant here

970
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:15,094
to look through
Sidney Jouron's locker.

971
00:38:15,145 --> 00:38:16,289
Were you aware
that he deals drugs?

972
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:17,580
He used to.

973
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:20,549
I gave him a job here as part
of his early release.

974
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:25,738
I'll open his locker for you.
SWEETS: Uh, so,

975
00:38:25,772 --> 00:38:26,906
I've been thinking
about you and your father...

976
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,241
(cries out)

977
00:38:28,275 --> 00:38:30,576
Okay, that cannot
be a coincidence.

978
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:32,445
There's something going on
with his dad.

979
00:38:32,496 --> 00:38:35,615
I haven't seen my dad in years.

980
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,917
These doors here,

981
00:38:37,951 --> 00:38:40,953
what angle do they-they
come down on?

982
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:44,373
45 degrees. Why?
45 degrees.

983
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:45,323
45 degrees.

984
00:38:45,348 --> 00:38:46,709
What's that got
to do with my dad?

985
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,744
You slammed your brother's leg
in the car door, didn't you?

986
00:38:48,762 --> 00:38:51,080
After he was dead.
You're saying I killed him?

987
00:38:51,098 --> 00:38:53,599
I loved my brother.
Why would I do that?

988
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:55,384
We're gonna find traces of blood
in the seat, aren't we, Alex?

989
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:57,103
SWEETS:
I can see it all happen.

990
00:38:57,137 --> 00:38:58,554
Your dad got his drugs
from Sidney.

991
00:38:58,588 --> 00:38:59,605
He didn't pay his debts.

992
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,057
Sid busts up his leg,

993
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:02,992
so he comes to you two guys
for help.

994
00:39:03,026 --> 00:39:05,378
Now, Benji thought your dad
was dead so, unlike you,

995
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:06,579
he was thrilled
to see him.

996
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,197
Benji was gonna give
your dad the money,

997
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:09,632
so you followed him to the barn.

998
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:11,367
You didn't want to shoot Benji,
but he stepped in the way.

999
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:12,342
To protect his father.

1000
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,505
He was gonna give the old man
his college money.

1001
00:39:15,538 --> 00:39:17,673
I couldn't let him do that.

1002
00:39:21,878 --> 00:39:24,013
I never meant for...

1003
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:29,435
All he ever wanted
was to go back in time

1004
00:39:29,486 --> 00:39:31,771
and to meet his old man.

1005
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:40,329
He got his wish.

1006
00:39:40,364 --> 00:39:43,449
And look what happened.

1007
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:55,673
BRENNAN (over computer):
The extensive amount

1008
00:39:55,698 --> 00:39:57,380
of fracture lines are indicative

1009
00:39:57,381 --> 00:39:59,765
of a weapon
with a circular cross-section.

1010
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,185
Hey. Usually when we catch
a bad guy, we go home.

1011
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,688
Oh, yeah, I'm just trying
to commit to memory everything

1012
00:40:05,722 --> 00:40:07,473
that I learned
from Dr. Brennan.

1013
00:40:07,524 --> 00:40:10,343
Uh, take my advice--
get a notebook.

1014
00:40:10,377 --> 00:40:12,561
Oh, it's okay. I have
a photographic memory.

1015
00:40:12,595 --> 00:40:15,398
Okay. (chuckles)
Good night.

1016
00:40:15,432 --> 00:40:17,566
See you.

1017
00:40:21,438 --> 00:40:24,323
We caught the murderer,
Dr. Wells. You can go home.

1018
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:26,992
Yeah, see, I'm just
a little concerned

1019
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:29,611
that we may have caught him
because of good luck.

1020
00:40:29,629 --> 00:40:32,581
There's no such thing as good luck.
Well,

1021
00:40:32,615 --> 00:40:33,949
as I understand it,

1022
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:36,635
if Agent Booth hadn't brought
Dr. Sweets along

1023
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,588
and they hadn't seen Alex Garcia
get clunked on the head,

1024
00:40:39,622 --> 00:40:41,307
then we never would've
caught the guy.

1025
00:40:41,341 --> 00:40:43,959
That's not luck; that's teamwork.
It's the fact

1026
00:40:43,977 --> 00:40:44,960
that you don't believe in luck

1027
00:40:44,978 --> 00:40:46,258
that doesn't
let you see the role

1028
00:40:46,263 --> 00:40:47,847
that it played
in this investigation.

1029
00:40:47,898 --> 00:40:50,566
Nonsense. We've been working
together a long time.

1030
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,019
And since you have a degree
in complicated systems

1031
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:56,088
and imaginary numbers,

1032
00:40:56,123 --> 00:41:00,142
you know that what appears
to be synchronicity--

1033
00:41:00,177 --> 00:41:03,896
luck-- is nothing more
than a sophisticated array

1034
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,564
of cause and effect.

1035
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,049
I, uh...

1036
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:10,319
I don't have a degree
in complicated systems.

1037
00:41:10,353 --> 00:41:13,072
Oh, well, we all have
our areas of weakness.

1038
00:41:14,858 --> 00:41:16,325
Good night, Dr. Wells.

1039
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:20,062
Are you saying
that I'm lacking?

1040
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:38,664
BOOTH (laughing):
<i>That's funny.</i>

1041
00:41:38,698 --> 00:41:40,652
Well, I didn't tell you
that to make you laugh.

1042
00:41:40,677 --> 00:41:42,251
Well... (chuckles)

1043
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:44,553
I confess that in a moment
of weakness,

1044
00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:46,772
I took the opportunity
to make...

1045
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:48,808
Dr. Wells feel bad
about himself.

1046
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:50,392
He deserves it.
Trust me.

1047
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:52,186
It's probably the first time
he's met someone

1048
00:41:52,195 --> 00:41:53,279
that's smarter than him.

1049
00:41:53,313 --> 00:41:56,065
You're referring to me?
Yes.

1050
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:58,984
I have another confession.
Mm-hmm?

1051
00:41:59,035 --> 00:42:01,153
It's possible that...

1052
00:42:01,204 --> 00:42:03,906
I'm not smarter than he is.

1053
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,274
(clears throat)
Really?

1054
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:08,794
He saw the merit in your
get rich scheme before I did.

1055
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:11,914
Ah, the asteroid mining. Yes!
Yes.

1056
00:42:11,948 --> 00:42:12,998
I invested $10,000.

1057
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:14,884
Yeah, but wait a second.

1058
00:42:14,918 --> 00:42:17,017
I didn't put any money
into that at all.

1059
00:42:17,042 --> 00:42:18,504
Why not?

1060
00:42:18,505 --> 00:42:20,489
Because you're the smarter one.
I'm going

1061
00:42:20,524 --> 00:42:23,425
to point out that if I'd
trusted you from the beginning,

1062
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:25,010
I would've invested
in the asteroids

1063
00:42:25,061 --> 00:42:26,996
and I would've been
ahead of Dr. Wells.

1064
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:30,015
Right, so...
(clears throat)

1065
00:42:30,066 --> 00:42:33,718
logically speaking,
that makes me the smarter one.

1066
00:42:36,895 --> 00:42:38,762
No argument there?

1067
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:42,924
I'm thinking.
Ah, I hear nothing but asteroids.

1068
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:47,949
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==

1069
00:43:17,952 --> 00:43:19,357
What that mean?
