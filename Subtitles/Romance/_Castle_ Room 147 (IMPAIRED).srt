1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,231
We don't get too many transfers
to this place.

2
00:00:03,232 --> 00:00:04,891
- Where you from?
- Albany.

3
00:00:04,945 --> 00:00:07,055
I'm just so excited
to be in the big city.

4
00:00:07,079 --> 00:00:08,780
Yeah, well, don't get too excited.

5
00:00:08,817 --> 00:00:11,132
Same rooms as the ones
you cleaned in Albany.

6
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:14,678
Same beds, same carpets,
same mess every morning.

[ Gasps ]

8
00:00:16,112 --> 00:00:18,379
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:29,290
Do I smell coffee?

10
00:00:29,324 --> 00:00:32,660
If you do, it was made by elves.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,873
- Ohh! - Aah!
- Aah!

12
00:00:45,907 --> 00:00:47,575
Geez!

13
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:49,109
You scared me.

14
00:00:49,144 --> 00:00:51,145
Yeah, I think we all just
kick-started our day.

15
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:52,680
[ Sighs ] What are you doing here?
[ Cellphone chimes ]

16
00:00:52,714 --> 00:00:54,614
Oh, my tutoring job went late,

17
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:56,950
and the train
wasn't running back to my place,

18
00:00:56,985 --> 00:00:57,951
so I crashed here.

19
00:00:57,986 --> 00:00:59,153
Hope you don't mind.

20
00:00:59,187 --> 00:01:00,453
No! No, of course not.

21
00:01:00,488 --> 00:01:01,789
Matter of fact,

22
00:01:01,823 --> 00:01:03,523
um, now that you've broken up
with your boyfriend,

23
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:06,593
there's really no reason
you can't move back in here.

24
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:08,061
Actually, there are many reasons,

25
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:09,396
starting with "I have a lease."

26
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,164
Ah. I told you
I would help you with that.

27
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:13,533
And you know I... I don't like you
living in that place alone.

28
00:01:13,568 --> 00:01:16,035
Dad, it's fine. I can handle it.

29
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,738
I got to go. I have an early class.

30
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:19,772
[ Smooches ]

31
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:22,575
And we have an early murder.

32
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:24,711
[ Door opens and closes ]

33
00:01:24,745 --> 00:01:26,579
Well, it was one thing

34
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:27,934
when she was living there with Pi,

35
00:01:27,948 --> 00:01:28,981
but now that she's alone,

36
00:01:29,016 --> 00:01:30,649
why not dump the dump and come home?

37
00:01:30,684 --> 00:01:33,119
[ Chuckling ] Well, maybe
she's enjoying her independence.

38
00:01:33,153 --> 00:01:34,887
She doesn't have time for independence.

39
00:01:34,922 --> 00:01:37,456
She's got her tutoring gigs,
her classes, her work-study job.

40
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,557
She's exhausted.

41
00:01:38,592 --> 00:01:41,193
Well, Castle,
I mean, she's strong-willed.

42
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:42,328
Maybe it's pride.

43
00:01:42,362 --> 00:01:43,362
If it were pride,

44
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:45,264
she'd be more... well, proud.

45
00:01:45,298 --> 00:01:47,132
No, there's something else...

46
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,635
Another reason
why she's not coming home.

47
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:52,571
Sito!

48
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:53,606
Yeah.

49
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,840
Someone miss a check-out?

50
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:56,307
No, he checked out, all right.

51
00:01:56,342 --> 00:01:58,043
Housekeeping found this guy,
Justin Marquette,

52
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,211
dead in room 147.

53
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,213
His driver's license
says he lives nearby.

54
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:06,752
Single gunshot to the chest?

55
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:08,086
One is all it took.

56
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:11,822
Based on the entry wound,
I'd say a small-caliber handgun.

57
00:02:11,857 --> 00:02:13,124
Lividity and liver temp

58
00:02:13,158 --> 00:02:15,460
put the time of death
between 10:00 P.M. and midnight.

59
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:18,195
And he wasn't found until morning?

60
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,664
So how come no one heard the shot?

61
00:02:19,698 --> 00:02:21,198
All the neighboring rooms are empty.

62
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:24,402
The manager says that the place
is only about 40% occupied.

63
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,437
Did the manager mention
him checking in with anyone?

64
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:27,972
The room was in his name alone.

65
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:30,507
Ryan's trying to track down
the desk clerk from last night

66
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,009
to see if he can get some more details.

67
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:33,277
There's no sign of forced entry, though.

68
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:35,246
So either the killer was with him,

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,647
- or the victim let him in.
- Yeah.

70
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:41,051
It looks like he took a bottle of water

71
00:02:41,086 --> 00:02:45,188
from this mini-fridge,
turned back around, got shot,

72
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:46,990
and then he took the chair down
with him.

73
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:49,192
There's no luggage.

74
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:50,794
You said he lives nearby.
What was he doing here?

75
00:02:50,828 --> 00:02:51,995
I don't know. I checked his phone.

76
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:53,863
There was no indication of a meeting.

77
00:02:53,898 --> 00:02:55,766
There was no appointments,
calls, or texts

78
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,100
in the hours leading up to his death.

79
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:58,368
Hey.
[ Sighs ]

80
00:02:58,403 --> 00:03:00,483
Found the desk clerk
who checked in Justin Marquette.

81
00:03:00,504 --> 00:03:01,805
Something's up with this guy.

82
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:04,274
Jane: Uh, Mr. Marquette
came at about 8:00.

83
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:06,475
No reservation, which is not unusual.

84
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,750
Jane, tell them about the room.

85
00:03:07,778 --> 00:03:09,145
Well, that was unusual.

86
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,047
He asked to stay in room 147.

87
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,381
In fact, he insisted on it.

88
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,017
Is there anything special about 147?

89
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:15,518
No, all our rooms are identical.

90
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:16,852
That's why it was so strange.

91
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:18,020
Had he been here before?

92
00:03:18,054 --> 00:03:19,355
Well, he's not in the system,

93
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:20,889
which means he's never been a guest

94
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:22,558
at any Best Traveler hotel.

95
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:24,259
Did he mention why he was staying?

96
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:25,594
He didn't have to.

97
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:29,365
Good-looking guy, no bags,
checking in for one night?

98
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:32,034
In my experience, that means
he was here to hook up.

99
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:33,902
Did he come here with anyone?

100
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:35,170
No, but he was texting with someone.

101
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:37,372
I figured that's who he was meeting.

102
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:39,541
He texted? Are you sure?

103
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:42,444
We didn't find any texts on his phone.

104
00:03:42,478 --> 00:03:43,979
I'm positive.

105
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:47,049
There.

106
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,451
See? He's texting.

107
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:50,852
On a flip phone.

108
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:53,555
That's not the phone we found.

109
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:55,289
As far as I can tell,

110
00:03:55,324 --> 00:03:57,565
that's the only cellphone
registered to Justin Marquette.

111
00:03:57,593 --> 00:04:00,695
So the one we saw in the video
must be a second, secret one.

112
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,597
Which the killer took
to hide their identity.

113
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:04,031
So who is this guy,

114
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:07,601
why a second phone, and why room 147?

115
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:09,355
I didn't get much
from hotel security video.

116
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:11,072
Coverage is sketchy,
and there are no cameras

117
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:12,673
in the hallway outside Justin's room.

118
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:14,141
Did you get ahold of next of kin?

119
00:04:14,176 --> 00:04:16,878
Not yet, but I did find out
about our victim

120
00:04:16,912 --> 00:04:18,645
through his personal website.

121
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,747
He's got his own website?

122
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:20,848
Yeah, he was an actor...

123
00:04:20,883 --> 00:04:22,583
a struggling one,
judging by his credits.

124
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:23,684
"Justin Marquette"

125
00:04:23,718 --> 00:04:25,218
"is a member

126
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:26,353
"and is currently appearing"

127
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:28,154
"in their off-off-off

128

"of Chekhov's 'Platonov.'"

129
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,092
That's a lot of "off" s.

130
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:35,729
Let's see if anyone down there
knows what he was into.

131
00:04:35,764 --> 00:04:38,565
This is the absolute end.

132
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,665
What's going on out there?

133
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,901
Osip's been lynched by the villagers.

134
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:44,470
I'm sorry. This is a closed rehearsal.

NYPD. I'm detective Beckett.

136

We're here about Justin Marquette.

00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:53,880
What about Justin? Is he okay?

138

[ Sniffles ]

139
00:04:56,517 --> 00:04:57,617
We met through the theater company

140
00:04:57,651 --> 00:04:59,251
and started dating three months ago.

141
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:00,386
[ Sniffles ]

142
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:01,554
I knew something was wrong

143
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:03,122
when he didn't show up
for rehearsal today.

144
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:04,724
And when was the last time you saw him?

145
00:05:04,758 --> 00:05:06,058
Yesterday morning at my place.

146
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:07,993
We, um... we went for a run,

147
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:10,496
and then he showered and left for work.

148
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:11,898
Where did he work?

149
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:13,299
Temp jobs, mostly.

150
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,534
He wasn't getting much recently,

151
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:18,404
but he said that he didn't mind,
because...

152
00:05:18,438 --> 00:05:20,406
because it gave him more time
to spend with me.

153
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:24,576
Any idea what he would be doing

154
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,012
at the Best Traveler Hotel last night?

155
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:28,213
No... uh, hotel?

156
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:30,114
He was... he was at a hotel?

157
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:32,517
[ Sighs ] Look, Laura,
I know this is difficult,

158
00:05:32,552 --> 00:05:35,186
but is it possible that Justin
was seeing someone else?

159
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,188
What? No.

160
00:05:37,222 --> 00:05:39,825
Was he involved in anything
dangerous or illegal?

161
00:05:39,859 --> 00:05:42,293
No, not... not that I know of. No.

162
00:05:42,328 --> 00:05:43,528
Was there anyone in his life

163
00:05:43,563 --> 00:05:45,129
that might have wanted to harm him?

164

There was that thing
the other day, remember?

165
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,201
What thing?

166
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:52,603
Some crazy woman walked up
to him on the street

167
00:05:52,637 --> 00:05:53,737
and threatened him.

168
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:55,806
That's right.
Justin was totally rattled.

169
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:57,641
He could barely perform that night.

170
00:05:57,676 --> 00:05:59,743
- Did he know who she was?
- Mnh-mnh.

171
00:05:59,778 --> 00:06:01,245
And he did not want to
talk about it, either.

172
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,081
All he said was that it happened
outside a coffee shop

173
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:05,148
on 9th and Mercer.

174

Thanks. Hey.

175
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:10,488
That was the coffee shop.

A barista saw the whole thing go down.

- You get a description?
- I did better than that.

180

The woman's a regular customer.

and her name's Anita Miller.

this case had conspiratorial promise.

202
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,080
Well, most likely Justin was cheating
on his girlfriend with Anita,

203
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:13,481
and the two of them met up at the hotel,

204
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,116
and that's where things went south.

205

Yes, well, most likely, that is boring.

What's wrong?

211
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,963
Well, I was looking into
Anita Miller's whereabouts

212
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:31,099
to try to tie her to the hotel,
except her credit-card records

213

show that she was at
Le Fagio restaurant last night.

214
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:34,569
So maybe someone else
used her credit card.

215
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:36,837
Nah. The manager I.D.'d her.

216
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:38,606
And he said that she split
the bill with another guy,

217
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,874
her A.A. sponsor.

218
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:41,208
I just spoke to him, and he confirmed

219
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:44,812
that they were together
from 9:30 P.M. to 12:30 A.M.

220

But that's our entire
time-of-death window.

221
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,416
If that's true,
then Anita can't be our killer.

222

Then why is she confessing?

So, Anita Miller
is confessing to the murder,

227
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:14,794
and she has an alibi.

228
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,800
Yeah, we're still trying
to make sense of it, sir.

229
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:19,124
Is it possible that we misjudged
the time of death?

230
00:08:19,156 --> 00:08:21,592
No. No, Lanie stands behind
her examination.

231
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,560
Okay, then, what about the alibi?

232
00:08:23,595 --> 00:08:25,896
Esposito verified it
with the restaurant.

233
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,231
The manager, the hostess,
even the waiter

234
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:30,333
confirmed that Anita
was there all evening.

Not only that,

but this restaurant
is nowhere near the hotel.

Then she couldn't
have killed the victim,

And then what happened?

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,994
He looked surprised.

261
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:34,696
He staggered back.

262
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,364
He dropped the bottle of water,

263
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:38,900
and he kind of gripped onto
the back of this chair.

Then he fell and knocked it over.

[ Clears throat ]
Okay.

325
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:58,768
[ Clears throat ]
I think...

326
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:02,806
I'm man enough to admit
I'm completely theory-less.

327
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:07,010
Maybe Anita suffered
some kind of psychotic break.

328
00:12:07,044 --> 00:12:08,411
I've ordered a psych eval,

329
00:12:08,445 --> 00:12:09,913
but psychosis doesn't explain

330
00:12:09,947 --> 00:12:11,648
how she knew all about the murder.

331
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:13,750
Or why she killed the guy
in the first place.

332
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:14,784
I double-checked her phone records.

333
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:16,152
There's not a single call or text

334
00:12:16,186 --> 00:12:17,520
between her and Justin Marquette.

335
00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:19,034
It's like they had no history at all.

336
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:21,224
Okay, why don't you guys
go over to her apartment

337
00:12:21,258 --> 00:12:23,660
and check everything...
e-mails, calendars, her diary...

338
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:25,128
and let's see
if we can find anything there

339
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,329
that'll connect her to our victim.

340
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:28,331
We're on it.

341
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,135
Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle,
good to see you.

342
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,170
Thank you so much for coming in,
Dr. Holloway.

343
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:36,805
I gather you have a patient for me.

344
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,242
Oh, yeah.

345
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:41,043
Well, we've been through
every room in the house.

346
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:43,145
No gun, no bloody clothes,

347
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,248
nothing that links Anita back to
that crime scene or to Justin.

348
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:48,817
Maybe not, but check out her date book.

349
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,132
Some pages have been ripped out,

350
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:51,553
including all of the last two weeks.

351
00:12:51,587 --> 00:12:53,255
- Two weeks? Wait a minute.
- Yeah.

352
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:55,190
- That's how long Anita says she's been
feeling "blurry." - Mm-hmm.

353
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:57,626
Maybe she kept a calendar
on her computer.

354

[ Mouse clicking ]

355
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,698
Yeah, looks like she did,

356
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:06,234
but the same two weeks have been erased.

357
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:07,902
Seems like someone's
trying to cover something up.

358
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:09,504
Yeah, but who? And what?

359
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,241
As much as I love a good mystery,

360
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:16,544
a small part of me is hoping
he can give us some clarity

361
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:18,680
on what the hell is going on.

362
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,049
Uh, speaking of clarity,
what did you mean

363
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,117
when you said that there
might be something else

364
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:25,553
that's keeping Alexis
from moving back to your loft?

365
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:26,554
I don't know!

366
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:28,589
And Alexis won't talk about it, so...

367
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:30,357
Maybe when Dr. Holloway's
done talking to Anita,

368
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,692
I can get him to talk to Alexis.

[ Door opens ]

370
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:36,297
Hey. So, what's the verdict?

371
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:37,998
Based on my examination so far,

372
00:13:38,032 --> 00:13:39,900
I find her to be mentally competent,

373
00:13:39,934 --> 00:13:41,168
if somewhat disoriented.

374
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:43,970
By all indications, she seems
to be telling the truth.

375
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:45,939
Meaning she did kill Justin Marquette?

376
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:47,253
Or she believes she did, anyway.

377
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:48,842
And what about the disorientation?

378
00:13:48,876 --> 00:13:50,010
How do you account for that?

379
00:13:50,044 --> 00:13:51,912
Could be medical
or a neurologic condition,

380
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:53,113
adverse reaction to drugs.

381
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:55,782
It's possible she experienced
a traumatic event

382
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:58,318
which caused some sort
of retrograde amnesia.

383
00:13:58,352 --> 00:14:00,420
So, traumatic like killing someone?

384
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:01,955
Potentially.
I'm gonna do a full work-up.

385
00:14:01,989 --> 00:14:03,556
I'll know more
when the results come back.

386
00:14:03,591 --> 00:14:06,326
Thank you, doctor.

387
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,894
So, Anita Miller
believes she killed the victim,

388
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:10,930
but the facts say she couldn't have.

389
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:12,398
No, not all the facts.

390
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:14,734
I mean, we know she accosted
Justin outside the coffee shop,

391
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:17,270
she confessed to the murder,

392
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:18,938
and she has intimate knowledge
of the crime.

393
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:20,106
So, look.

Clearly, we haven't
explained everything, but...

she's our best suspect.

Yeah... so far, the confession

411
00:15:02,761 --> 00:15:04,362

Yeah, take a number.

Once we realized that someone might've
gone through Anita's apartment,

we had UNIs canvass the area.

Now, one of Anita's neighbors
remembers seeing a red van

parked outside her place
about two weeks ago.

Right when she started
feeling disoriented.

Yeah, not only that, we checked in

seeing the same red van

525
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:44,466
parked outside of Carson's house
a few nights later.

526
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:46,903
She remembers it because she
thought it looked suspicious.

527
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,337
Did you get a plate number?

528
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:50,907
No, but she took a picture
with her phone.

529
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,574
Take a look who's behind the wheel.

530
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,544
Is that...

531
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:57,780
A big, bald man,

532
00:19:57,814 --> 00:19:59,881
just like the one Anita said she saw

533
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,950
talking to our victim
outside the coffee shop.

534
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:03,452
So our victim and two suspects

535
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:04,953
do have something in common.

536
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:06,955
Yeah... him.

537
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,987
- So, now there are three of them.
- Yes, sir.

538
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:20,269
But we believe that this man
is the key to our case.

539
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:23,110
His van was seen outside
both Anita and Sam's apartments,

540
00:20:23,144 --> 00:20:24,845
and Anita I.D.'d him as the guy

541
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:27,581
that was talking to our victim
outside the coffee shop.

542

And what is this man's
connection to Mr. Carruthers?

That's what I'm gonna find out.

to take full responsibility

And what is that?

648
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,005
Well, to quote their website,

"E.H.I. provides sanctuary,
enlightenment,"

are satisfied customers.

In 2005, three of those followers died

in some kind of sweat-lodge initiation.

655

Charges were filed, but, ultimately,

656
00:25:07,153 --> 00:25:08,786
the deaths were ruled accidental.

657

quit drinking, uh,

In small doses, it's mainly
a blood-pressure drug.

787

In high doses, it's been found
to alter memories,

even eliminate them.

could it make someone believe

00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,423
Have three suspects
confess to the same crime,

804
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,324
making it impossible
for the police to arrest anyone.

805

how they all knew the details

filmed the murder

810

and then showed it to these people

811
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:33,940
while they were in
their drug-induced state?

812

And, uh, what did you see
when you went in the room?

837

I remember the carpet. It was beige.

838
00:32:24,557 --> 00:32:27,725
The wallpaper
had a subtle floral pattern,

839
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,260
and there was a painting
above the fridge.

840

00:36:46,435 --> 00:36:47,568
they'd actually killed Justin.

966
00:36:47,603 --> 00:36:49,303
We... we halted the program immediately.

967
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:50,905
But the damage was already done.

968
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,674
They threatened to sue.

969
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:56,011
They said we were using them
as Guinea pigs.

970
00:36:56,045 --> 00:36:57,278
Which you were.

971
00:36:57,312 --> 00:36:59,013
We tried to help them.

972
00:36:59,047 --> 00:37:02,283
We brought them back
for one final session

973
00:37:02,317 --> 00:37:03,784
to... correct the problem.

974
00:37:03,818 --> 00:37:04,785
And by correcting,

975
00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:06,754
you mean dosing them with Propranolol

976
00:37:06,788 --> 00:37:09,257
so that they would forget
they ever visited E.H.I.?

977
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:11,759
We were just trying to help people.

978
00:37:11,793 --> 00:37:15,428
Is that why you sent madsen
after Justin... to "help" him?

979
00:37:15,463 --> 00:37:17,931
Madsen only talked with Justin

980
00:37:17,966 --> 00:37:20,567
to remind him
of the confidentiality agreement

981
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:23,436
that prohibited him
from talking about the program.

982
00:37:23,471 --> 00:37:25,272
We knew nothing about his murder.

983
00:37:25,306 --> 00:37:29,877
And yet his death was staged
to mirror that video exactly.

984
00:37:29,911 --> 00:37:31,344
Why would we do that

985
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:34,581
when we were just trying
to make this go away?

986
00:37:34,615 --> 00:37:35,982
No, no, no, no, no.

987
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:38,885
Someone's targeting us,
someone who knew about that tape

988
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:40,853
and knew they could use it against us.

989

Uh, uh, one of the other test subjects,

990
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,023
someone on the crew.

991
00:37:46,227 --> 00:37:47,460
I'm gonna need a list

992
00:37:47,495 --> 00:37:49,495
of all of the people
that knew about that video.

993
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:52,799
Pam: Be sure not to step
any further downstage,

994

in the head when it flies in.

Detective Beckett.

997
00:37:58,605 --> 00:38:00,006
Do you have news about Justin's case?

998
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,074
We do.

999
00:38:01,108 --> 00:38:04,077
We now believe that Justin was killed

1000
00:38:04,111 --> 00:38:05,511
because of a video that he acted in.

1001
00:38:05,545 --> 00:38:07,112
A video?

1002
00:38:07,146 --> 00:38:08,980
It was made for an organization
called E.H.I.,

1003
00:38:09,015 --> 00:38:12,451
and it just so happens it was
edited by Kahn Post Production.

1004
00:38:12,485 --> 00:38:14,152
Eddie: Kahn Post?

1005
00:38:14,187 --> 00:38:17,022
Pam, isn't that where your day job is?

1006
00:38:17,056 --> 00:38:19,258
Yeah, but I don't know about any video.

1007
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:20,392
We think you do.

1008
00:38:20,427 --> 00:38:22,060
And when you saw the video,

1009
00:38:22,095 --> 00:38:23,428
you saw an opportunity.

1010
00:38:23,462 --> 00:38:25,797
Pam, we checked your credit card.

1011
00:38:25,832 --> 00:38:28,700
We know that
you just bought a flip phone.

1012
00:38:28,735 --> 00:38:30,702
So?

1013
00:38:30,737 --> 00:38:32,570
So just before Justin died,

1014
00:38:32,605 --> 00:38:35,373
he was texting someone on a flip phone,

1015
00:38:35,407 --> 00:38:36,541
presumably his killer.

1016
00:38:36,575 --> 00:38:38,175
Beckett: When we looked into
the phone records,

1017
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:41,279
there were texts supposedly
from E.H.I. to Justin,

1018
00:38:41,313 --> 00:38:45,149
offering him $5,000 to
reprise his role in that video.

1019
00:38:45,183 --> 00:38:48,753
I'm betting that you gave Justin
that phone,

1020
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:52,690
probably told him someone from E.H.I.
dropped by, wanted him to have it.

1021
00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:55,025
But it wasn't E.H.I. that
sent those texts. It was you.

1022
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,863
You lured him to that hotel,
and then you killed him.

1023
00:38:58,897 --> 00:39:00,765
Wait. This is crazy.
[ Chuckles ]

1024
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:01,932
Justin was my friend.

1025
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:03,100
Why would I do that?

1026
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:04,969
We checked your background, Pam.

1027
00:39:05,003 --> 00:39:06,771
One of the men that was killed

1028
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:10,207
in that E.H.I. sweat-lodge
initiation was Alan Clark...

1029
00:39:10,242 --> 00:39:11,408
your brother.

1030
00:39:11,442 --> 00:39:13,410
E.H.I. was to blame,

1031
00:39:13,444 --> 00:39:14,778
but no one was held accountable.

1032
00:39:14,812 --> 00:39:17,614
His death was ruled accidental.

1033
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:19,115
And when you watched that video,

1034
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,585
you realized you had the perfect
chance to take them down.

1035
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:23,086
But you knew that you needed Justin

1036
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,220
in order to pull it off,

1037
00:39:24,255 --> 00:39:26,290
so you found a way to get close to him.

1038
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:29,159
Oh, my God. That's why you
joined our theater company.

1039
00:39:29,193 --> 00:39:30,293
Pam, what did you do?

1040
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:32,728
You don't understand.

1041
00:39:32,763 --> 00:39:35,731
I had to do it...
for Alan, for the others.

1042
00:39:35,766 --> 00:39:38,001
Those monsters had to be stopped.

1043
00:39:38,035 --> 00:39:39,669
By killing an innocent man?

1044
00:39:39,703 --> 00:39:43,806
Justin was not innocent.
He was one of them.

1045
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,009
He was just an actor, hired for the day.

1046
00:39:47,043 --> 00:39:48,411
Then why did he stonewall me

1047
00:39:48,445 --> 00:39:50,479
when I tried to talk to him about it?!

1048
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:56,084
They are all accountable!

1049
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:58,287
Somebody had to stop them!

1050

Somebody had to show the world
what they really are!

was about revenge?

What about Dr. Bauer?

and the FBI is launching
a full-scale investigation.

And the guy in the red van,
the one who drugged us?

trying to cross into Canada.

Carruthers: What I don't understand

1063
00:40:36,524 --> 00:40:38,525
is what made us come in when we did,

it was some kind of trigger.
