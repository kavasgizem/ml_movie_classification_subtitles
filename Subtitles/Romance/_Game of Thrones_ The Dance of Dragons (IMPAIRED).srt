1
00:00:02,577 --> 00:00:04,423
A girl will return to the docks.

2
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:06,089
She will watch
the gambler.

3
00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:07,214
And then what?

4
00:00:07,238 --> 00:00:09,538
A gift for the thin man.

5
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:12,061
Why should I spend
my time listening to you?

6
00:00:12,062 --> 00:00:14,974
You have no one at your side who
understands the land you want to rule.

7
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:16,517
What would you
have me do with him?

8
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,672
A ruler who kills
those devoted to her

9
00:00:18,696 --> 00:00:20,823
is not a ruler
who inspires devotion.

10
00:00:20,847 --> 00:00:22,742
Remove Ser Jorah
from the city.

11
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:26,324
You said whoever wins will fight
at the Great Pit in front of the queen.

12
00:00:26,348 --> 00:00:27,797
Let me fight for her.

13
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,636
The Iron Bank has called
in the crown's debts.

14
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:33,996
We must send an envoy
to show these bankers our respect.

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,023
Ser Meryn will
lead your escort.

16
00:00:38,097 --> 00:00:39,977
Cersei: There are only two
like it in the world.

17
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,861
The one I'm wearing,
the one I gave to Myrcella.

18
00:00:41,877 --> 00:00:45,178
Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.

19
00:00:45,202 --> 00:00:46,811
Dorne's too dangerous
for you.

20
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:47,878
I've come to take you home.

21
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:50,242
I love Trystane,
I'm going to marry him,

22
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:51,876
and we're staying
right here.

23
00:00:52,815 --> 00:00:54,337
This is about
survival.

24
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:56,136
<i>The Night's Watch will let you</i>
<i>through the tunnel.</i>

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,104
If you swear you'll join us
when the real war begins.

26
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:01,709
The white walkers don't care.

27
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:03,929
We're all the same to them,
meat for their army.

28
00:01:03,953 --> 00:01:05,882
But together
we can beat them.

29
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,404
We still have a hard march
to Winterfell

30
00:01:14,428 --> 00:01:16,412
and we won't be marching
anywhere in this weather.

31
00:01:16,436 --> 00:01:18,534
It's better to wait for the right time
than risk everything.

32
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:20,913
This is the right time
and I will risk everything.

33
00:01:20,937 --> 00:01:23,482
Because if I don't,
we've lost.

34
00:01:23,974 --> 00:01:26,133
I have shown you
the power of king's blood.

35
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,879
We don't have
Robert's bastard here.

36
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,317
We are more prepared
for a siege than they could ever be.

37
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:34,341
The snow is so deep,

38
00:01:34,353 --> 00:01:36,180
we couldn't get
an army through to engage them

39
00:01:36,204 --> 00:01:37,480
even if we wanted to.

40
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:38,703
I don't need an army.

41
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:40,679
I need 20 good men.

Davos: A band of 20 men,
maybe less.

57
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,133
They were in and out
before anyone spotted them.

58
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:49,085
Burnt our food stores
to the ground,

59
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:51,337
all our siege weapons
destroyed.

60
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:53,723
- Dozens of tents were--
- Horses?

61
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,892
We're still getting a count,
but hundreds are dead.

62
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:59,596
20 men rode into our camp
without a single guard sounding the alarm?

63
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:02,182
The northerners know
more about their land than we ever will.

64
00:05:02,184 --> 00:05:03,817
Put last night's guards
in chains.

65
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:05,518
Either they fell asleep
or they conspired with the enemy.

66
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,441
Find out the truth
and then hang them.

67
00:05:07,502 --> 00:05:09,065
Your Grace.

68
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:12,408
Unless there's a thaw,
we can't press forward to Winterfell

69
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:15,028
and we don't have enough food
to get us back to Castle Black.

70
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,913
We're not returning
to Castle Black.

71
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:17,814
Forgive me, Your Grace,

72
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:20,028
I never claimed to be an expert
in military matters,

73
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:23,953
but if we can't march forward
and we won't march back...

74
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:39,886
Have the dead horses
butchered for meat.

75
00:06:20,562 --> 00:06:22,762

79
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:12,729
Open the gates.

80
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:16,866

82

Jon:
It was a failure.

83
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:33,549
It wasn't.

84
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:35,802
I went to save them.
I failed.

85
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:39,639
You didn't fail him.

86
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:41,007
Or him.

87
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:43,843
<i>Or her.</i>

88
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:47,347
Every one of them is alive
because of you and no one else.

89
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,317
I don't think
that fact's lost on them.

90
00:08:45,323 --> 00:08:48,658
You have a good heart,
Jon Snow.

91
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,160
It'll get us all killed.

92
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:59,135
Alliser:
Out of my way.

93
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:15,601
<i>( horse neighs )</i>

94
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:17,937
<i>( men shouting )</i>

95
00:09:20,275 --> 00:09:21,941
( sighs )

96
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,779
You sent for me,
Your Grace?

97
00:09:26,781 --> 00:09:29,032
Find some healthy horses and
a few knights to guard you.

98
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:31,084
I'm sending you back
to Castle Black.

99
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:33,336
Tell the Lord Commander
his king commands him

100
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:35,755
to send food, supplies,
fresh horses.

101
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,540
In return,
when I take the throne,

102
00:09:37,592 --> 00:09:40,593
I'll make sure the Night's Watch has
all the men it requires.

103
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:43,930
He can guard all 19 castles
on the Wall if he so wishes.

104
00:09:46,217 --> 00:09:49,218
Your Grace,
you named me your Hand.

105
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,803
Yes.

106
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:52,805
The King's Hand should
never abandon the king,

107
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:54,273
especially
in time of war.

108
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:56,142
You're not abandoning me.
You're obeying a command.

109
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:58,561
A boy with a scroll
could deliver this message.

110
00:09:58,613 --> 00:10:01,147
And if Jon Snow refuses
the boy with the scroll,

111
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:03,399
what does the boy say?

112
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:05,618
I didn't name you Hand for your expertise
in military matters.

113
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:08,154
Ride for Castle Black.
Don't come back empty-handed.

114
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,913
Your Grace,
perhaps Queen Selyse

115
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:18,831
and Princess Shireen
could accompany me.

116
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:20,917
My family stays with me.

117
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:23,002
At least let me
take Shireen.

118
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:25,555
<i>A siege is no place</i>
<i>for a little girl.</i>

119
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,974
My family stays with me.

120
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:38,267
( men coughing )

121
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:05,378
What's this one now?

122
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,763
"The Dance of Dragons:
A True Telling"

123
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,215
by Grand Maester Munkun.

124
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:12,602
Now that sounds
like a proper story.

125
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:15,271
Ser Byron Swann wanted
to kill the dragon Vhagar.

126
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:18,274
He polished his shield
for a week so that it was like a mirror.

127
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:20,359
And he crouched behind it
and crept forward,

128
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:22,435
hoping the dragon would
only see its own reflection.

129
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:25,565
But the dragon saw
a dumb man holding a mirrored shield.

130
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,233
And burnt him
to a crisp.

131
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:28,451
( laughs )

132
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:30,870
Thus ending
the dragon-slaying career

133
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:33,739
of Ser Byron Swann.
( laughs )

134
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:38,327
I made you something,
Princess.

135
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,219
Do you like it?

136
00:11:46,254 --> 00:11:48,137
He's beautiful.

137
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:50,890
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

138
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:53,426
Will you make me a doe, too?
So that he can have company?

139
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:55,311
Of course I will.

140
00:11:56,764 --> 00:11:58,397
But why am I
getting a present?

141
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:01,484
Because you deserve it.

142
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:06,656
My son was always on me,
trying to teach me to read.

143
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:09,025
Gods, I was stubborn
about it.

144
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:11,994
Made it this far
without reading.

145
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,530
Seemed to me I could
make it to the grave.

146
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:18,784
Wish I'd listened to him.

147
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:22,622
This is my own poor way
of saying thank you.

148
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:28,377
For teaching me
to be a grown-up.

149
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:33,849
I'll be gone for a few days,
Princess.

150
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:36,552
I want to hear all about
"The Dance of Dragons" when I'm back.

151
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:38,854
You'll read it yourself.

152

00:13:11,472 --> 00:13:13,272
What a lovely dress.

159
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:15,608
- You don't like it?
- You must be cold.

160
00:13:15,677 --> 00:13:19,278
Not at all.
The Dornish climate agrees with me.

161
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:23,149
Prince Trystane.

162
00:13:25,153 --> 00:13:26,485
How's your jaw?

163
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:29,322
A fleabite.

164
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:30,940
What are you
doing in Dorne?

165
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:33,242
Looking after the safety of my niece,
the Princess Myrcella.

166
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,612
And rather than send a raven
or speak to me directly,

167
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:38,998
you decided to enter
my country in secret

168
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:40,666
and abduct our guest
by force?

169
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:43,919
We received
a threatening message.

170
00:13:43,955 --> 00:13:47,173
The princess's necklace
in the jaws of a viper.

171
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:50,509
That necklace
was stolen from my room.

172
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:59,268
Oh, excellent.

173
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:01,520
A last meal before
the beheading?

174
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:03,105
Oh, I can't behead you.

175
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:05,558
Many in Dorne want war.

176
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,560
But I've seen war.

177
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:10,363
I've seen the bodies
piled on the battlefields.

178
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:13,899
I've seen the orphans
starving in the cities.

179
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:15,985
I don't want to lead
my people into that hell.

180
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,738
No, you want to break bread
with the Lannisters.

181
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,374
And that is precisely
what we are doing.

182
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:26,796
Let us drink to Tommen,
the First of His Name,

183
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:29,332
<i>King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the First Men,</i>

184
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:31,550
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

185
00:14:40,478 --> 00:14:42,311
( slams )

186
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:51,404
King Tommen insists

187
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:54,407
on his sister's return
to the capital?

188
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:56,575
I'm afraid he does.

189
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:01,697
I cannot disobey
my king's command.

190
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:04,200
She will return with you
to King's Landing.

191
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:07,670
<i>And my son Prince Trystane</i>
<i>will accompany you both.</i>

192
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:11,340
If the alliance between
the Iron Throne and Dorne is to continue,

193
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:12,842
their engagement
must stand.

194
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:14,960
I accept.

195
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:17,680
One more thing.
My brother was named

196
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:20,383
to the small council
before his death.

197
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:22,351
Your father understood
the importance

198
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:24,220
<i>of keeping Dorne</i>
<i>in the fold.</i>

199
00:15:24,272 --> 00:15:28,808
With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take
his place on the small council.

200
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:29,975
You have my word.

201
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:32,528
The word
of a kingslayer.

202
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:39,068
No wonder you can't stand.
You have no spine.

203
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,370
You are mother
to four of my nieces,

204
00:15:41,456 --> 00:15:43,155
girls I love very much.

205
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:45,991
For their sake, I hope you live
a long and happy life.

206
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:48,544
Speak to me that way again,
and you won't.

207
00:15:56,337 --> 00:16:00,005
May I inquire as to the fate
of my man Bronn?

208
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:03,175
Tell me, Ser Jaime,
in King's Landing,

209
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:06,479
how do they punish a commoner
who strikes a prince?

210
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:08,063
He said it was
just a fleabite.

211
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:12,234
The fault is mine.

212
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,520
Bronn is merely a soldier
following my orders.

213
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:18,107
If anyone should
be punished, it's me.

214
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,026
Prince Trystane must learn judgment
if he is to rule one day.

215
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:22,778
I'll let him decide.

216
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:30,202
I have learned the value of mercy
from my father.

217
00:16:30,254 --> 00:16:33,672
-<i> I'll set your man free.</i>
- You're a good man.

218
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,542
On one condition.

219
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:38,961
<i>( hands slapping )</i>

220
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:46,602
Why do we play?
I'm better than you.

221
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:48,971
I'll always
be better than you.

222
00:16:49,023 --> 00:16:51,857
Have I ever missed once?

223
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:54,777
I don't think I have.
I can't recall.

224
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:57,396
You must love humiliation.
Or pain.

225
00:16:57,448 --> 00:17:01,116
Which do you love most,
humiliation or pain?

226
00:17:02,203 --> 00:17:04,069
That one hurt,
didn't it?

227
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:07,072
- ( smacks )
- You going to cry?

228
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:09,041
Give up, little sister.

229
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:11,126
- You're going to miss.
- Oh, I never miss.

230
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:14,463
You will.
You're thinking too much.

231
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:17,550
Now you're nervous.
What if she's right?

232
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:23,756
- Luck.
- Now it's my turn.

233
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:25,424
You're too slow.

234
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:27,309
You've always been
too slow.

235
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:35,651
<i>( cell door unlocks )</i>

236
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:45,911
Am I gonna be happy
at the end of this walk?

237
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:47,997
You'll find out
very soon.

238
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:52,751
Say it one more time,
handsome.

239
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:54,203
Who am I?

240
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,123
The most beautiful
woman in the world.

241
00:17:58,175 --> 00:17:59,542
And that's the truth.

242
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:02,211
- Slut.
-<i> ( Tyene laughs )</i>

243
00:18:02,263 --> 00:18:04,213
Prince Doran,

244
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:07,299
Ser Bronn
of the Blackwater.

245
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:09,702
I didn't realize there were
knights of the Blackwater.

246
00:18:09,737 --> 00:18:11,337
Only the one.

247
00:18:11,372 --> 00:18:13,906
I believe you've already
met Prince Trystane.

248
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:16,141
Prince.

249
00:18:16,143 --> 00:18:17,893
Sorry about
the other day.

250
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:20,396
Jaime: <i>Prince Trystane here</i>
<i>is a man of mercy.</i>

251
00:18:20,448 --> 00:18:22,781
He's agreed to grant
you your freedom.

252
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:26,485
I'm glad to hear it.

253
00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:29,321
Pie looks good.

254
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:31,957
There was one condition.

Oysters, clams,

How much

Oysters, clams,

Oysters, clams,
and cockles.

I hope your journey
was trouble-free.

280

A bit of chop

Nothing too awful.

Good to see the old chap

And how goes
the harvest in the Reach?

Ah, the vintners say

Trant: <i>Thought that old shit</i>

318
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,890
Wasn't bad, though.

319
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:27,559
The Tyrells can all
rot in hell.

320
00:22:27,561 --> 00:22:29,228
Treasonous cunts.

321
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,147
They were going to make
that boy-fucker Renly king.

322
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,117
This is the place, lads.

323
00:22:35,152 --> 00:22:37,569
The sleekest little minks
in Braavos.

324
00:22:37,621 --> 00:22:40,489
- You buying?
- Oh, I'm buying.

325
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,741
But I never was good
at sharing.

- ( chatter, laughter )
-<i> ( music playing )</i>

327
00:23:03,564 --> 00:23:05,898
Sell your fish
somewhere else.

328
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:08,767
Oh, let her in, Brusco.
I'm hungry.

329
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:10,769
Come here, sweetness.

330
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:17,743
They say oysters
get the juices flowing.

331
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:19,995
We'll take
half a dozen.

332
00:23:21,782 --> 00:23:23,665
Three coppers.

333
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:27,119
Here's a silver
because the lady likes you.

334
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:55,197
Too old.

335
00:23:58,619 --> 00:23:59,952
Brea.

336
00:24:15,135 --> 00:24:16,668
Too old.

<i>But well worth it,</i>
<i>I assure you.</i>

340
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:36,688
Too old.

341
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:46,365
Do you have
what I want or not?

342
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:50,252
Of course.
Of course.

343
00:24:55,676 --> 00:24:57,709
- ( gasps )
- These fresh?

344
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:04,299
Come on,
the lads are hungry.

345
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:12,107
Nothing better for your cockstand
than fresh oysters.

346
00:25:12,142 --> 00:25:14,192
- Guard:<i> Here. Thank you.</i>
- Guard #2:<i> I'll have one.</i>

347
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:17,229
<i>Any vinegar?</i>

348
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:20,532
Who let this girl in?
Shoo! Shoo!

349
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:23,702
( guards chuckle )

350
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:43,055
Good.

351
00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:54,232
I'll tell you
when we're done.

352
00:25:59,907 --> 00:26:01,940
You'll have a fresh one
for me tomorrow?

353
00:26:01,942 --> 00:26:04,276
Of course.

354
00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:10,499
Madame: <i>I'll have you</i>
<i>whipped, girl.</i>

355
00:26:10,534 --> 00:26:12,918
Go, go on.
Out, out, go.

356
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:21,093
( whispering )

357
00:26:24,765 --> 00:26:26,681
Valar morghulis.

358
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,767
Valar morghulis.

359
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:45,617
And?

360
00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:48,370
The thin man
wasn't hungry today.

361
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:50,489
Perhaps that is why
a man is thin.

362
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:52,290
Tomorrow.

363
00:26:52,326 --> 00:26:55,494
- Tomorrow.
-<i> ( thuds )</i>

364
00:26:56,547 --> 00:26:58,580
A girl has work to do.

365
00:27:11,845 --> 00:27:15,430
Your rebellion is over.

366
00:27:15,482 --> 00:27:18,266
You can swear
your allegiance to me now...

367
00:27:19,736 --> 00:27:21,686
or you can die.

368
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:49,681
( crying )

369
00:27:56,857 --> 00:27:59,141
I believe
in second chances.

370
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:03,862
I don't believe
in third chances.

371
00:28:32,092 --> 00:28:34,259
You write like
a seven-year-old.

372
00:28:35,812 --> 00:28:38,096
Your maester kindly agreed
to copy it over for me.

373
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:39,598
<i>He didn't try</i>
<i>to make you pay?</i>

374
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,349
Mm-mmm.

375
00:28:41,435 --> 00:28:43,518
Maybe he's changed.

376
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,821
The queen will be thrilled
to know you're bringing her daughter home.

377
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:48,106
She will.

378
00:28:48,158 --> 00:28:50,609
You love her very much,
don't you?

379
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:53,111
Of course,
she's my niece.

380
00:28:53,163 --> 00:28:55,080
I wasn't talking
about her.

381
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:59,084
You think I disapprove?

382
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,752
Why?

383
00:29:00,787 --> 00:29:03,788
Because people disapprove
of that sort of thing where you are from?

384
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,958
They disapproved of Oberyn
and me where you are from.

385
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:10,712
Here no one
blinked an eye.

386
00:29:12,015 --> 00:29:13,215
100 years ago,

387
00:29:13,267 --> 00:29:15,967
no one would have
blinked an eye at you

388
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:17,769
if you'd been named
Targaryen.

389
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,725
It's always changing, who we're
supposed to love and who we're not.

390
00:29:24,978 --> 00:29:27,112
The only thing
that stays the same

391
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:29,981
is that we want
who we want.

392
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,077
I know your daughter had no part
in the terrible thing

393
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:44,246
that happened
to the man I love.

394
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:49,417
Perhaps even you
are innocent of that.

395
00:30:00,597 --> 00:30:03,315
<i>( horse whinnying )</i>

396
00:30:06,486 --> 00:30:07,852
<i>( tent flap rustles )</i>

397
00:30:07,854 --> 00:30:09,854
Father.

398
00:30:13,327 --> 00:30:14,659
Aren't you cold?

399
00:30:16,997 --> 00:30:19,080
No.
What are you reading?

400
00:30:20,534 --> 00:30:22,701
- "The Dance of Dragons."
- What's it about?

401
00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:25,203
It's the story of the fight between
Rhaenyra Targaryen

402
00:30:25,255 --> 00:30:28,540
and her half-brother
Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms.

403
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:31,376
Both of them thought
they belonged on the Iron Throne.

404
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:34,713
When people started
declaring for one of them or the other,

405
00:30:34,715 --> 00:30:36,965
their fight divided
the kingdoms in two.

406
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:40,385
Brothers fought brothers,
dragons fought dragons.

407
00:30:42,055 --> 00:30:46,057
By the time it was over,
thousands were dead.

408
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:49,060
And it was a disaster
for the Targaryens as well.

409
00:30:49,062 --> 00:30:51,813
They never truly recovered.

410
00:30:51,865 --> 00:30:53,865
"The Dance of Dragons."

411
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:57,652
Why is that a dance?

412
00:30:57,704 --> 00:30:59,154
It's just what
they call it.

413
00:30:59,206 --> 00:31:01,406
Hmm, doesn't make
much sense.

414
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:03,375
I think it's poetic.

415
00:31:10,217 --> 00:31:12,751
If you had to choose

416
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:16,137
between Rhaenyra
and Aegon...

417
00:31:17,724 --> 00:31:19,224
who would you
have chosen?

418
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:21,810
I wouldn't have
chosen either.

419
00:31:21,845 --> 00:31:25,013
It's all the choosing sides
that made everything so horrible.

420
00:31:25,065 --> 00:31:27,349
Sometimes a person
has to choose.

421
00:31:29,436 --> 00:31:32,687
Sometimes the world
forces his hand.

422
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:37,575
If a man knows
what he is...

423
00:31:38,945 --> 00:31:41,780
and remains true
to himself...

424
00:31:45,285 --> 00:31:47,452
the choice
is no choice at all.

425
00:31:47,537 --> 00:31:50,588
He must fulfill
his destiny...

426
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:56,261
and become
who he is meant to be.

427
00:31:58,465 --> 00:32:00,799
However much
he may hate it.

428
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:04,969
It's all right, Father.

429
00:32:04,971 --> 00:32:07,806
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

430
00:32:07,858 --> 00:32:09,641
It doesn't matter.

431
00:32:09,643 --> 00:32:11,893
I want to help you.

432
00:32:11,945 --> 00:32:13,611
Is there any way
I can help?

433
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:22,871
Yes, there is.

434
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:24,739
Good. I want to.

435
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:29,794
I'm the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

436
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,080
And I'm your daughter.

437
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:45,059
( sighs )

438
00:32:46,346 --> 00:32:48,313
Forgive me.

439
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:31,806
Where's my father?
I want to see my father.

440
00:33:31,858 --> 00:33:34,976
It will all be over
soon, Princess.

441
00:33:38,949 --> 00:33:40,398
( crying )
No.

442
00:33:43,236 --> 00:33:45,236
Where's my father?

443
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:47,739
No, you can't do this.
Father, where are you?

444
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:50,241
<i>Please, let me</i>
<i>see my father.</i>

445
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:53,127
<i>Father, where are you?</i>
<i>Don't let her do this.</i>

446
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,831
Please let go!

447
00:33:56,883 --> 00:34:00,168
<i>Let me see my father!</i>
<i>Where are you? Please!</i>

448
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,287
- Selyse: It's what the Lord wants.
- Shireen: No.

449
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:06,340
-<i> Please! Let go! No!</i>
- It's a good thing.

450
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,509
- A great thing.
- Shireen:<i> Stop. Stop!</i>

451
00:34:08,544 --> 00:34:10,210
- Shireen:<i> Please!</i>
- Melisandre:<i> Hear us now, my Lord.</i>

452
00:34:10,211 --> 00:34:11,162
Shireen:<i> You can't do this!</i>

453
00:34:11,186 --> 00:34:12,545
Melisandre:<i> For you, we offer up this girl</i>

454
00:34:12,546 --> 00:34:13,408
Please!

455
00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:15,396
<i> ...that you may cleanse</i>
<i>her with your fire</i>

456
00:34:15,397 --> 00:34:17,347
and that its light
may lead our way.

457
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:19,431
Shireen:<i> Please!</i>
<i>No, please let me see my father.</i>

458
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,600
If we don't act,
we'll all starve here.

459
00:34:21,652 --> 00:34:23,602
-<i> All of us.</i>
-<i> ( Shireen crying )</i>

460
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:25,320
But if we make
this sacrifice...

461
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,573
Melisandre: <i>Accept this token</i>
<i>of our faith, my Lord,</i>

462
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:30,442
and lead us
from the darkness.

463
00:34:30,494 --> 00:34:33,445
- Lord of Light, show us the way.
- Mother!

464
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:35,614
Mother, please!

465
00:34:37,585 --> 00:34:39,117
Mother, please!
Mother!

466
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,203
-<i> Mother!</i>
- We can't.

467
00:34:41,255 --> 00:34:41,943
There's no other way.

468
00:34:41,944 --> 00:34:43,289
- She has king's blood.
- <i> Please don't do this!</i>

469
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,290
Melisandre: <i>Lord of Light,</i>
<i>protect us.</i>

Perhaps you should go

People used to bet against me when
I fought in the pits.

He would have bet against me.
Common novice mistake.

514
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:04,599
I've spent much
of my life in this arena.

515
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:06,635
And in my experience,
large men do triumph

516
00:39:06,687 --> 00:39:08,970
over smaller men
far more often than not.

517
00:39:09,022 --> 00:39:11,890
Has your experience
ever involved any actual fighting?

518
00:39:11,942 --> 00:39:13,558
You yourself?

519
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:16,528
Have you ever tried to kill another man
who was trying to kill you?

520
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:21,449
Whenever I got into the pit
against a beast like that one,

521
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:24,152
the crowd saw me,
all skin and bone back then,

522
00:39:24,204 --> 00:39:27,489
then they saw a pile of angry muscles
ready to murder me.

523
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:29,741
They couldn't get their
money out fast enough.

524
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:33,245
But the pile of angry muscles
never had any muscles here

525
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:36,631
or... here.

526
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,416
And the big men
were always too slow

527
00:39:38,468 --> 00:39:41,303
to stop my dagger from going
where their muscles weren't.

528
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:45,173
Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one
standing across from me

529
00:39:45,225 --> 00:39:49,311
making his beast faces,
I knew I could rest easy.

You don't approve?

There's always been more than enough death
in the world for my taste.

I can do without it
in my leisure time.

534
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:10,582
Fair enough.
Yet it's an unpleasant question,

535
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:15,003
but what great thing has ever been
accomplished without killing or cruelty?

536
00:40:15,088 --> 00:40:18,340
It's easy to confuse what is
with what ought to be,

537
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,126

has worked out in your favor.

I'm talking about
the necessary conditions for greatness.

That is greatness?

541

That is a vital part
of the great city of Meereen,

542

which existed
long before you or I

If it comes to that, they will have died
for a good reason.
