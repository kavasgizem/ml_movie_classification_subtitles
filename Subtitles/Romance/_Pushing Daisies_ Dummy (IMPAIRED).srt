1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,460
WHO ARE YOU?

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,330
YOU WERE MY FIRST KISS.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,920
YOU WERE MY FIRST KISS,TOO.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,460
YOU TOUCH MURDER VICTIMS, YOU ASK WHO KILLED THEM.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,400
YOU TOUCH THEM AGAIN, THEY GO BACK TO BEING DEAD,

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,640
AND YOU COLLECT THE REWARD?

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,930
THAT'S IT IN A NUTSHELL.

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,780
- ARE YOU THE BUSINESS PARTNER?
- YES,MA'AM.

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,510
DOESN'T SHE LOOK A LOT LIKE THAT DEAD GIRL?

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,060
SHE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THAT DEAD GIRL.

11
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,700
DO YOU...TOUCH ANYTHING?

12
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,340
I T-TOUCH LOTS OF THINGS.

13
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,070
DOES HE TOUCH YOU?

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,220
I'D KISS YOU IF IT WOULDN'T KILL ME.

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,930
Emerson: ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HER? IT'S THAT LEVEL OF STUPID.

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,930
I KIND OF KILLED HER DAD WHEN I WAS 10.

17
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,000
SHE DOESN'T KNOW.

18
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,170
I JUST THOUGHT MY WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE IF YOU WERE IN IT.

19
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,500
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD KNOW?

20
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,350
NO.

21
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,460
Narrator: AT THIS VERY MOMENT, IN THE TOWN OF NORTH THRUSH,

22
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:03,190
YOUNG NED WAS 9 YEARS,33 WEEKS,6 DAYS,20 HOURS, AND 34 MINUTES OLD.

23
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,830
HE STOOD ON THE EXACT SPOT WHERE,

24
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,830
4 WEEKS AND 2 DAYS PREVIOUSLY,

25
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,810
HIS FATHER HAD DEPOSITED HIM AT THE LONGBURROW SCHOOL FOR BOYS.

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,950
AS YOUNG NED'S MOTHER HAD DIED RECENTLY,

27
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,810
THERE WAS REASSURING PHYSICAL CONTACT AND PARTING WORDS.

28
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,510
"I'LL BE BACK."

29
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,470
HE LIED.

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,380
THE SADNESS AND DREAD WHICH THE BOY FELT

31
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,900
WERE NOT SO MUCH A PRODUCT OF THE LONGBURROW SCHOOL.

32
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,660
YOUNG NED'S ACUTE DISCOMFORT CAME FROM THE KNOWLEDGE

33
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,210
THAT WHEN HE TOUCHED A DEAD THING,IT CAME BACK TO LIFE.

34
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,510
THE OTHER BOYS ASSUMED HIS INTROVERTED NATURE

35
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,970
WAS A PRODUCT OF WEAKNESS AND CODDLING.

36
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,000
THINKING OF REVENGE AND ALSO NOT THINKING AT ALL,

37
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,890
YOUNG NED VOLUNTEERED TO ASSIST WITH THAT DAY'S SCIENCE PROJECT.

38
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,590
YOUNG NED'S SECRET GIFT WAS GOVERNED BY TEE SIMPLE RULES --

39
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,770
TOUCH A DEAD THING ONCE,ALIVE.

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,730
TOUCH A DEAD THING AGAIN...

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,240
...DEAD FOREVER.

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,990
KEEP A DEAD THING ALIVE FOR MORE THAN A MINUTE...

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,390
AND SOMETHING ELSE HAS TO DIE.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,610
HIS GIFT HAD,ONCE AGAIN, BROUGHT HIM GREAT DISTRESS IN PLACE OF GREAT JOY.

45
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,710
HE VOWED TO KEEP THE STRANGE DETAILS OF HIS STRANGE LIFE SECRET FROM THE WORLD FOREVER.

46
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,980
ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,190
Narrator: SO,YOUNG NED DID WHAT HIS FATHER HAD DONE TO HIM ONLY 31 DAYS BEFORE.

48
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,070
NO.

49
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,440
Narrator: HE LIED.

50
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,860
FOR THE NEXT 19 YEARS, 29 WEEKS,AND 2 DAYS,

51
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,350
KEEPING SECRETS WORKED BEAUTIFULLY.

52
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,170
THE BOY BECAME THE PIE MAKER,

53
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,010
AND THE PIE MAKER DECEIVED WITH EASE...

54
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,860
- UNTIL CHUCK.- THIS IS STRANGE.

55
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,120
Narrator: CHARLOTTE CHARLES HAD BEEN ALIVE

56
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,200
FOR 28 YEARS,24 WEEKS,3 DAYS, 11 HOURS,AND 51 MINUTES BEFORE SHE WAS MURDERED.

57
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,070
IS THIS STRANGE?

58
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,640
THIS IS NOT STRANGE.UNUSUAL,

59
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,570
MAYBE ECCENTRIC, IN A QUAINT WAY, LIKE DESSERT SPOONS.

60
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,300
Narrator: REVIVED BY THE PIE MAKER

61
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,910
AND GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE,

62
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,770
SHE HAD MANY QUESTIONS.

63
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,190
I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS, MY MIND WANDERS.

64
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,820
YOU NEED TO FEED IT WARM MILK AND A TURKEY SANDWICH.

65
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,130
LET IT CURL UP IN A SUNNY SPOT AND TAKE A NAP.

66
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,790
I MISS MY AUNTS.

67
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,040
OF COURSE. DO YOU MISS THEM A LOT?

68
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,330
A LITTLE.

69
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,580
ALL THE TIME?

70
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,400
NOW AND THEN.

71
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,410
Narrator: AS CHUCK SPOKE,SHE REALIZED HER SECRETS WERE "REALLY A LOT"

72
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,600
AND "EVERY MINUTE," IN THAT ORDER.

73
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,170
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU TOUCHED?

74
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,680
PEOPLE OR ANIMALS? CROSSING.

75
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,590
DIGBY DOESN'T COUNT. DIGBY DOES COUNT.

76
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,410
NO ONE'S BEEN THROUGH AS MUCH WITH ME AS DIGBY.

77
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,410
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE?

78
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,690
IT'S NOT LIKE I WALK AROUND REVIVING CHILDHOOD SWEETHEARTS WILLY-NILLY.

79
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,420
WELL,WHAT ABOUT EMERSON,HUH? OH,COMING THROUGH!

80
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,450
YOU TOUCHED LOTS OF PEOPLE WITH EMERSON.

81
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,190
FOR WORK.

82
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,880
JUST BECAUSE YOU KILL THEM AGAIN AS SOON AS YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT

83
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,770
DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY DIFFERENT. YES,IT DOES.

84
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,530
COMING THROUGH.

85
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,180
AND CAN WE NOT SAY "KILL"? I TOUCH THEM AGAIN IS ALL,

86
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,910
AND THEY SNAP RIGHT BACK TO THE WAY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.

87
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,190
AM I THE RUBBER BAND THAT BROKE?

88
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,790
CHUCK,YOU'RE THE ONLY HUMAN BEING

89
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,820
I'VE EVER MADE ALIVE AGAIN TO STAY.

90
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,040
Narrator: HE LIED.

91
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,520
IN FACT,THE PIE MAKER HAD KEPT ONE OTHER PERSON ALIVE

92
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,040
FOR LONGER THAN A MINUTE.

93
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,930
USING THE GIFT TO TEMPORARILY REVIVE HIS OWN MOTHER,

94
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,090
THE UNINTENDED EFFECT ON CHUCK'S FATHER HAD BEEN MORE PERMANENT.

95
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,030
THPIE MAKER OFTEN ASKED HIMSELF IF HE WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO TELL CHUCK THIS SECRET.

96
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,090
YOUR EYE'S TWITCHING.

97
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,000
IS IT?

98
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,360
THIS IS SUCH A SMALL CHEESE BOX.

99
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,900
Narrator: THE AUNTS WHO HAD RAISED CHUCK HAD TAUGHT HER TO BELIEVE

100
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,260
THAT THE LARGE WHITE APPLIANCE IN THE KITCHEN

101
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,420
HAD A FAIRLY NARROW PURPOSE.

102
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,640
AUNT LILY,IS IT OKAY TO FREEZE THE CAMEMBERT?

103
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,830
I'D RATHER NOT WEDGE IT BETWEEN THE EDAM AND THE PANEER!

OR I COULD AIR OUT THE GOUDA!

105
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,570
Narrator: IN FACT,YOUNG CHUCK DID NOT REFER TO A REFRIGERATOR

106
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,960
AS ANYTHING BUT A CHEESE B UNTIL SHE WAS 17.

107
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,710
AS CHUCK CONSIDERED THE LIFE SHE COULD NEVER GO BACK TO,

108
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,320
OLIVE SNOOK CONSIDERED THE CHANGES IN HER OWN LIFE --

FROM HER PERCH,THE JEALOUS YET AGILE NEIGHBOR

DURING TIMES OF STRESS OR ANXIETY,HE LIKED TO KNIT.

118

WE'RE FROM THE GOVERNMENT SAFETY PLACE?

160
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,730
[ With teeth clenched ] IS THAT A QUESTION?

161
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,970

162
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,100
Narrator: THE FACTS WERE THESE.

163
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,530
ONE BERNARD SLAYBECK,

164
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,960
AN UNMARRIED AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY SPECIALIST --

165
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,320
35 YEARS,10 WEEKS,7 HOURS, AND 3 MINUTES OLD --

166
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,570
WAS FOUND DEAD BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD...

167
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,720
...THE APPARENT VICTIM OF A HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER.

168
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,000
Narrator: AS THERE WERE NO WITNESSES, THE POLICE ARE OFFERING A REWARD

169
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,010
FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO THE ARREST OF THE KILLER.

170
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,110
I'M GONNA WAIT BACK HERE.

171
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,710
YOU DON'T LIKE DEAD BODIES, DO YOU?

172
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,200
NOT WHEN THEY SIT UP AND TALK.

173
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,120
POOR MAN. JUSTOUCH IT.

174
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,480
I'M STARTING THE WATCH.

175
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,020
HEY. HEY.

176
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,350
WHY IS EVERYTHING SO BLURRY?

177
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,080
PROBABLY BECAUSE YOUR EYEBALLS ARE FLAT. ASK THE QUESTION.

178
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,450
MR. SLAYBECK,DO YOU -- DO YOU HAVE ANY LAST REQUESTS,

179
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,420
UNFINISHED BUSINESS FROM THIS LIFE WE CAN HELP YOU WITH?

180
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,060
DON'T LET HER DO THIS. IS THIS HEAVEN?

181
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,310
COULD BE. NO,IT'S NOT.

182
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,070
IS THAT GOD? NO,IT'S NOT.

183
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,560
I'M CONFUSED, BECAUSE I'M A BUDDHIST.

184
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,240
BUDDHISM IS FASCINATING, ISN'T IT?

185
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,820
DID IT HELP YOU IN YOUR FINAL MOMENTS?

186
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,240
SHE'S WASTING MY MINUTE.

187
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,550
WHAT'S WITH THIS MINUTE? AND WHEN DID IT BECOME YOUR MINUTE?

188
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,660
SURE THE HELL AIN'T YOURS.

189
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,370
HEY,IT'S EVERYONE'S MINUTE, OR,UH,22 SECONDS.

190
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,670
CAN YOU GET A MESSAGE TO EARTH?

191
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,980
CAN YOU TELL JEANINE IN PROMOTIONS THAT I LOVED HER?

192
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,020
OF COURSE.

193
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,960
MR. SLAYBECK,IF YOU COULD REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT

194
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,690
WHOEVER WAS DRIVING THE HIT-AND-RUN VEHICLE THAT KILLED YOU,

195
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,060
I THINK WE CAN GET YOU SOME JUSTICE.

196
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,490
WHAT HIT-AND-RUN? I WAS KILLED BY A CRASH-TEST DUMMY.

197
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,540
I'M NOT GOD,BUT IF I WAS, I'D BE AN ANGRY GOD.

198
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,120
OH,WE GAVE IT OUR BEST SHOT.

199
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,820
SO,A CRASH-TEST DUMMY KILLED BERNARD.

200
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,310
BERNARD WAS DELUSIONAL.

201
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,320
IT'S STILL A CLUE. IT'S A DEAD END.

202
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,140
AND NOT THE KIND OF DEAD END YOU CAN UNDEAD

203
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,780
AND THEN REDEAD AGAIN, LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO.

204
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,840
IT'S MY FAULT?

205
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,790
WHEN YOU GET ALL JABBERWOCKY IN MY MINUTE,

206
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,640
IT'S HARD TO FOLLOW UP ON "THE DUMMY DID IT."

207
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,640
GOT TO GET SOME REAL LEADS NOW.

208
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,950
ISN'T THAT WHAT A P.I.'s SUPPOSED TO DO?

209
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,450
INVESTIGATE? ISN'T THAT THE FUN PART?

210
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,180
THE FUN PART'S COUNTING MY MONEY IN THE BUBBLE BATH.

211
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,490
NICE IMAGE.

212
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:36,800
OH,BOY.

213

SO,WHO'S THE FUNNY GIRL STUCK TO NED?

CHILDHOOD SWEETHEART.

228
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,680

229
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,700

230
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,200
Narrator: OLIVE SNOOK DID NOT WANT THE TRUTH,

231

BUT HER HEART WAS SO FULL

232
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,450
THAT IT REACHED UP AND NODDED HER HEAD.

233

HE DIGS HER IN A WAY HE DEFINITELY DOESN'T DIG YOU.

234
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,740
I-I'LL JUST GO GET YOUR PIE.

235

236
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,170
WISH THEY WOULD.

237
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,750
EMERSON THINKS I'M USELESS.

238
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,690
YOU'RE NOT USELESS. HERE,LET ME. YOU SIFT.

239
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,120
USELESS IS AN EMPTY SOAP DISPENSER IN A RESTROOM,

240
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,160
STANDING AROUND REMINDING PEOPLE WHAT YOU COULD BE DOING,

241
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,500
BUT DOING NOTHING AT ALL.

242
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,290
UH,MORE FLOUR.

243
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,900
I CAN'T BE ALIVE AGAIN FOR NO REASON.

244
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,760

245
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,400
WE'LL FIND THE KILLER. EMERSON'S GOOD AT WHAT HE DOES.

246
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,220
ALL EMERSON CARES ABOUT IS THE REWARD.

247

MAYBE THAT'S ENOUGH. IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

248
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,730

251

IT WAS HIS DYING WISH.

252
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,640
IT'S SO SAD.

253
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,680

254

Narrator: AS THE PIE MAKER SECRETLY THOUGHT

257

258
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,740

BUT IT SEEMED KIND OF REDUNDANT

319
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,150
WITH THE COMMERCIAL PLAYING ALL THE TIME.

320
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,040
WE'RE HERE ON A MORE TRAGIC MATTER ABOUT BERNARD SLAYBECK.

321
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,650
MAYBE YOU GOT THE WRONG FLOWER,

322
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,680
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BERNARD.

323
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,870
Narrator: SHE LIED.

324
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:21,580
ARE YOU SURE?

325
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,970
I KNOW WHAT I KNOW. IS THAT PIE?

326
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,740
IT WAS BAKED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE RECIPIENT OF BERNARD'S MESSAGE.

327
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,400
WELL,IT'S A SHAME TO WASTE A PERFECTLY GOOD PIE.

328
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,680
MAN,THAT SMELLS GOOD.

329
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,560
YOU'RE DROOLING. BERNARD SAID --

330
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,550
HE'S DEAD,RIGHT?

331
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,040
Narrator: THE FLOWER HAD A SECRET.

332
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
YEAH,HE'S DEAD. ENJOY YOUR PIE.

333
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,390
Narrator: BUT HER TRAINING AS A DISPLAY MODEL

334
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,540
ALLOWED HER TO CONCEAL ANY TRACE.

335
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,480
Mark: TIME TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STOP,PEOPLE --

336
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,480
THE CRASH-TEST FACILITY!

337
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,300
"CRASH-TEST FACILITY"?

338
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,490
DUMMIES. FEEL LIKE TAKING A TOUR?

339
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:59,370
Narrator: SAFELY OUT OF SIGHT, THE FLOWER BEGAN TO WEEP.

340
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,580
LIKE THE RICH,SUGARY DESSERT SHE BINGED ON,

341
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,000
HER TEARS WOULD REMAIN WITH HER

342
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,430
FOR ONLY THE NEXT 10 TO 15 MINUTES

343
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,650
BEFORE THEY WOULD BE PURGED FROM HER BODY,

344
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,840
LIKE THEY HAD NEVER EXISTED.

345
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,450
Mark: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

346
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,120
WELCOME TO THE DANDY LION WORLDWIDE CRASH-TEST FACILITY.

347
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,350
SCIENCE GUYS,

348
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,330
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET OUR NEWEST DANDY LION DEALERS

349
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,850
FROM A LITTLE TERRITORY I LIKE TO CALL ASIA.

350
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,700
[ SPEAKING JAPANESE ]

351
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,440
SCIENCE GUY,TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENS IN HERE.

352
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,780
[ Indian accent ] UM,THIS IS WHERE WE USE

353
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,360
ELECTRONIC ANTHROPOMORPHIC UNITS...

354
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,820
DUMMY DES.

355
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,460
...TO TEST THE DANDY LION SX FOR STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY,

356
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,730
AS WELL AS THE VIABILITY OF ALL THE RESTRAINT-

357
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,190
AND IMPACT-INITIATED SAFETY SYSTEMS.

358
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,920
WE CRASH THINGS IN HERE. BOOM DES KA!

359
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,610
NOW,WHOANTS TO PULL THE LEVER?

360
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,720
Narrator: AS THE GROUP THRILLED TO THE SIGHT

361
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,360
OF TWISTED METAL AND SIMULATED LOSS OF LIFE AND LIMB,

362
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,180
CHUCK CAME UPON AN EQUALLY CHILLING SIGHT OF HER OWN.

363
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,330
ONE OF THESE DUMMIES IS NOT LIKE THE OTHERS.

364
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,730
WHERE DID HIS CLOTHES GO?

365
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,750
WHERE DID HIS FACE GO?

366
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,940
MAYBE BERNARD WASN'T CRAZY.

367
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,650
THE DUMMY DID IT.

368
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,730
OR AT LEAST SOMEONE IN DUMMY MASK AND AN ORANGE JUMPSUIT.

369
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:07,880
CHUCK FOUND THE CLUE.

370
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:08,690
I FOUND THE CLUE.

371
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,120
"CLUE" IS A BOARD GAME.

372
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,700
THE PROFESSOR DID IT IN THE PARLOR WITH A RUBBER MALLET.

373
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,550
THAT'S A CLUE. WE FIND EVIDENCE.

374
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,000
YOU GOT TO ADMIT,THIS MEANS SOMETHING.

375
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,980
IT COULD BE A LEAD. WHO WOULD HAVE ACCESS?

376
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,250
LOOPY DANDY LION MODELS,ANGRY TECHNICIANS --

377
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,250
COULD BE ANYBODY.

378
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,760
I DID SOME CHECKING ON THAT CAR COMPANY.

379
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,890
THEY GOT A LOT RIDING ON THIS DANDY LION.

380
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,240
LOOF ANGRY COMPETITORS,TOO.

381
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,840
WE GOT TO GET BACK IN THERE TONIGHT.

382
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,090
OH,THAT'S NOT HOW WE DO IT.

383
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,600
WE GOT TO GET BACK IN THERE TONIGHT,

384
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,130
SEE IF WHOEVER TOOK THAT DUMMY MASK LEFT ANY EVIDENCE.

385
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,680
OLIVE?

386
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,970
HIYA!

387
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,550
WE'RE GOING OUT LATE TONIGHT,A PRIVILEGE THING,

388
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,770
HARDLY WORTH EXPLAINING.

389
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,100
CAN YOU CLOSE UP? I THINK I JUST DID.

390
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,240
WHAT?

391
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,790
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

392
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,350
BYE,OLIVE.

393
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,440
BYE,DIGBY.

394
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,760
Narrator: OLIVE OFTEN IMAGINED THERE WAS AN ORCHESTRA IN HER HEART,

395
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,920
MUSIC HEARD ONLY BY HER,

396
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,010
EXCEPT WHEN HER HEART BROKE OPEN

397
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,240
AND IT SPILLED OUT INTO THE WORLD.

398
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,290
* GUESS MINE IS NOT THE FIRST HEART BROKEN *

399
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:17,370
* MY EYES ARE NOT THE FIRST TO CRY *

400
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,050

402

403
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,480
EXCUSE ME.

404
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,080
WE'RE CLOSED.

405
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:48,040
* YOU KNOW,I'M JUST A FOOL WHO'S WILLING *

406
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:54,160
* TO SIT AROUND AND WAIT FOR YOU *

407
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,190
* BUT,BABY,CAN'T YOU SEE

408
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,570
* THERE'S NOTHING LEFT FOR ME TO DO? *

409
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,040
* I'M HOPELESSLY DEVOTED --

410
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,550
HI,OLIVE!

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,510
HI,MANUEL.

412
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,340
CAN DO THE FLOORS?

413
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,540
YEAH,OKAY.

414
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,410
* BUT NOW THERE'S NOWHERE TO HIDE *

415
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,550
* SINCE YOU PUSHED MY LOVE ASIDE *

416
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,720
* I'M OUT OF MY HEAD

417
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:34,980
* HOPELESSLY DEVOTED TO YOU

418
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:44,070
* HOPELESSLY DEVOTED TO YOU

419
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,520
DID YOU SAY SOMETHING? NO.

420
00:20:54,670 --> 00:21:06,000
* HOPELESSLY DEVOTED TO YOU-U-U-U-U *

421
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,770
Narrator: WHILE OLIVE CONSIDERED HOW MU SHE LOVED DIGBY

422
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,070
FOR PAYING ATTENTION TO HER WHEN THE PIE MAKER WOULD NOT,

423
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,100
AND DIGBY CONSIDERED HOW MUCH HE LIKED SALT...

424
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,010
...THE PIE MAKER CONSIDERED WHAT THE SENTENCE WOULD BE

425
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,680
FOR BREAKING AND ENTERING WITH NO PRIOR CONVICTIONS.

426
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,550
CONTACTED THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THESE DOORS

427
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,800
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.

428
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,130
THEY GAVE ME A SAMPLE I.D. BADGE,

429
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,280
WHICH I DIGITALLY ALTERED USING THE MAGNETIC CODE

430
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,850
THAT MATCHES THE SERIAL NUMBER OF THIS MACHINE.

431
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,060
IS THAT CHEATING?

432
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,670
I DON'T KNOW. IS THIS?

433
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,480
I GAVE THE SECURITY GUARD A HUG GOODBYE.

434
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,690
MY UPPER BODY DISTRACTED HIM

435
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,730
WHILE THESE THINGS I CALL HANDS TOOK THIS OFF HIS BELT.

436
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,980
Narrator: AT THAT MOMENT,

437
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,700
THE PIE MAKER FELT A MIXTURE OF HAPPINESS AND TREPIDATION.

438
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,730
WHY IS IT ALWAYS A MIXTURE?

439
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,300
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT EMERSON

440
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,890
BESIDES HE PRIVATELY INVESTIGATES?

441
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,130
WHAT IS SO GREAT ABOUT KNOWING?

442
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,790
WHEN YOU LIFT UP A ROCK,DO YOU FIND WHIPPED CREAM?

443
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,980
NO,YOU FIND WORMS.

444
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,880
I SAY NO TO KNOWING.

445
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,950
WE HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER IN 20 YEARS.

446
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,990
DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ME?

447
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.

448
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,970
LOOK,WE'VE ALL DONE THINGS WE'RE NOT PROUD OF.

449
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,370
WE ALL HAVE SECRETS.

450
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,380
WHAT SECRETS?

451
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,120
SKELETONS IN THE CLOSET.

452
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,980
EXACTLY. HOW LG HAVE YOU BEEN LISTENING?

453
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,540
THERE ARE SKELETONS IN THE CLOSET.

454
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,380
THOSE AREN'T SKELETONS.

455
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,030
THOSE ARE DEAD BODIES.

456
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,170
HEY! RICK! RICK PAGE.

457
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,970
Y,RICK. UH,DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

458
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,200
UH,LAST THING I REMEMBER,

459
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,980
I WAS READING SALES FORECASTS IN THE BACK.

460
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,410
GEEZ,THOSE THINGS ARE DULL.

461
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,850
YOU EVER HEARD OF THE DANDY LION CAR COMPANY? NOPE.

462
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,620
YOU WANT TO OPEN THE KIMONO

463
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,210
ON WHY I'M WEARING A SILVER LEOTARD AND HANGING FROM A HOOK?

464
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,390
DO YOU HAVE ANY LAST REQUESTS OR THOUGHTS?

465
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,130
IF I WANTED TO MINGLE WITH A BUNCH OF GEEKS WEARING LEOTARDS,

466
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,360
I'D HAVE STAYED IN ART SCHOOL.

467
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,180
YOU WENT TO ART SCHOOL?

468
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,740
DIDN'T KNOW THAT,DID YOU?

469
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,660
STOP IT!

470
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,530
I WAS JUST RIDING THE FERRIS WHEEL AT THE STATE FAIR,

471
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,120
AND THE TEENAGER RUNNING IT SAID I COULD RIDE AN EXTRA...TURN.

472
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,230
DID YOU EVER HEAR OF THE DANDY LION CAR COMPANY?

473
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,330
NO.

474
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,210
MOVING ON. WAIT A SEC.

475
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,930
I DID CHECK A BOX THAT SAID I COULD BE USED TO TEST AUTOMOBILE SAFETY.

476
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,670
SOUNDS SCARY,BUT WHEN YOU'RE DEAD,YOU'RE DEAD.

477
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,030
AM I DEAD?

478
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,760
THERE'S NOTHING ILLEGAL ABOUT ANY OF THAT?

479
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,170
AND WHY WOULD DANDY LION REPLACE

480
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,140
ALL THEIR CRASH-TEST DUMMIES WITH DEAD BODIES?

481
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,490
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE REAL DUMMIES?

482
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,560
Narrator: BEFORE EMERSON COD COULD REPLY WITH A CLEVER

483
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,530
IF SLIGHTLY INSULTING REMARK...

484
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,770
Shh,Shh.

485
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,460
SEE THAT?

486
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,610
JEANINE?

487
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,060
what?

488
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,950
I COULDN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING BEFORE BECAUSE THEY WERE WATCHING ME.

489
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,410
I HID AT WORK TO MAKE SURE NO ONE WOULD FOLLOW ME HOME.

490
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,560
THE TRUTH IS BERNIE AND I WERE SO IN LOVE.

491
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,140
IT ALL STARTED WHEN HE CAME TO SEE THIS SALES TRAINING THING

492
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,050
ON HIS LONG LUNCH BREAK,AND IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.

493
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,730
I COULDN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF HIM. HE JUST MESMERIZED ME.

494
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,880
MY HEART LEAPT OUT OF MY CHEST,AND I JUST COULDN'T LOOK AWAY.

495
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,690
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. I GOT ALL MISTY-EYED,YOU KNOW?

496
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:09,000
Narrator: AND AS JEANINE CONTINUED TO EAT HER TRIPLE-BER PIE,

497
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:12,970
SHE TOLD THEM THE STORY OF HER LOVE AFFAIR WITH BERNARD SLAYBECK.

498
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,190
PRESENT,PRESENT,PRESENT,PRESENT,PRESENT,PRESENT,

499
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,470
AND GIGGLE,GIGGLE,GIGGLE,GIGGLE,GOOD GIRLS.

500
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,160
Narrator: THEY HAD MET WHEN THE SCIENTIST HAD COME TO WATCH SALES TRAINING ON A LONG LUNCH.

501
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,810
THE ATTRACTION WAS INSTANTANEOUS,

502
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,350
AND THEY WOULD BOTH CONFESS TO REPLAYING THIS FIRST ENCOUNTER

503
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,190
AS THEY FELL ASLEEP IN THEIR BEDS THAT NIGHT.

504
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,580
HE WOULD REMEMBER HER HAIR AS BEING SLIGHTLY REDDER,

505
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,610
HER SWEATER SLIGHTLY TIGHTER,

506
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,710
BUT THE SMILE HE WOULD GET JUST RIGHT.

507
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,090
SHE WOULD REMEMBER HIS LOOK AS SHY BUT FLIRTATIOUS,

508
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,500
HIS TIE AS RED BUT VERY THIN,

509
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,710
AND THAT HIS SANDWICH WAS AN ANGUS BEEF PATTY

510
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,930
WITH BUTTERHEAD LETTUCE,ROMA TOMATOES,

511
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,030
ON A SESAME-SEED WHOLE-WHEAT BUN,

512
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,170
AND A GLASS OF 2% MILK.

513
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,740
AS THEY TALKED,THESE ARE THE THINGS SHE CAME TO KNOW FIRST.

514
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,100
THE SCIENTIST WAS KIND. THE SCIENTIST WAS LONELY.

515
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,100
THE SCIENTIST CAME ALIVE WHEN HE TOLD HER

516
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,450
ABOUT HIS HOBBY OF CATCHING BUTTERFLIES.

517
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,690
WHEN HE ADMITTED THAT HE ALWAYS SET THEM FREE,

518
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,320
SHE FELT DIZZY AND GIGGLED FOR NO REASON.

519
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,120
Narrator: THE WAIF AND THE SCIENTIST FELL DEEPLY IN LOVE,

520
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,490
HIDING THEIR AFFAIR FROM THE WORLD LIKE A TRADE SECRET.

521
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:52,410
BUT JEANINE FROM PROMOTIONS FELT A CHASM GROWING BETWEEN THEM.

522
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,390
AS THE LAUNCH OF THE FLOWER CAR GREW CLOSER,

523
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,180
BERNARD'S HOURS GREW LONGER.

524
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,490
HE BECAME DISTANT AND HARD TO REACH.

525
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,850
SUSPECTING HER SAFETY SCIENTIST OF STEPPING OUT ON HER,

526
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,790
SHE BEGAN TO SPY.

527
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,440
BUT THERE WAS NO OTHER FLOWER,

528
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,410
ONLY MYSTERIOUS TRIPS INTO THE DARKNESS.

529
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,110
WHERE DID SHE GO?

530
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,930
SORRY. RESTROOM. MINT,ANYONE?

531
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,520
NO,THANKS.

532
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,410
WHERE WAS SLAYBECK GOING ON THESE NIGHT DRIVES?

533
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,430
I COULD NEVER SEE.

534
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,630
AND WHEN I CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT IT,

535
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,630
HE WOULDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING.

536
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,100
I THOUGHT I WAS BEING PARANOID TILL HTURNED UP DEAD.

537
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,840
YOU GONNA FINISH THAT? YES.

538
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,580
I WISH WE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING.

539
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,100
OH,I FIGURED IT OUT. [ CHUCKLES ]

540
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,990
IT'S EASIER IF I SHOW YOU. FOLLOW ME.

541
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,330
SHOTGUN! CHUCK!

542
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,460
I HATE THE BACK.

543
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,590
DEAD,AGAIN,FOREVER.

544
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,440
FINE.

545
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,120
Chuck: SHE'S NOT GOING VERY FAST.

546
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,830
Ned: THAT CAR CAN'T HAVE A VERY BIG ENGINE.

547
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,020
MAYBE SHE ATE IT.

548
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,110
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

549
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,810
SHE OBVIOUSLY HAS A VERY SERIOUS DISORDER.

550
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,760
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? SERIOUSLY?

551
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,880
THE GIRL'S GOT A WHOLE SECRET LIFE IN THE BATHROOM.

552
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,800
AND I KNOW EXACTLY HOW SHE FEELS.

553
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,910
SO DO I.

554
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,860
I HATE HAVING SECRETS. NOW I AM ONE --

555
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,380
ALL THESE DISGUISES,HIDING IN YOUR APARTMENT ALL THE TIME.

556
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,670
I HATE SECRETS,TOO. YOU LOVE SECRETS.

557
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,620
YOU WANT TO MARRY SECRETS AND HAVE LITTLE HALF-SECRET,HALF-HUMAN BABIES.

558
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,900
WELL,I HAVE A SECRET,TOO. I DO MISS MY AUNTS.

559
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,380
THEN ALL I HAVE IS YOU.

560
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,970
WHICH IS GREAT,BUT...

561
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,410
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU SINCYOU WERE 9.

562
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,270
IT'S PRETTY MUCH I BAKE PIES AND WAKE THE DEAD.

563
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,660
I LIVE A VERY SHELTERED LIFE.

564
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,350
I ALREADY LIVED A SHELTERED LIFE ONCE.

565
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,500
BUT IT WASN'T AS SHELTERED AS YOU THINK.

566
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,630
AUNT LILY HAD A VERY EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF HISTORIC EROTICA HIDDEN IN THE MILK CELLAR.

567
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,060
THE MILK CELLAR.

568
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,450
THE CHEESE FLOOR,THE SPOOKY PLACE UNDER THE HOUSE,WHATEVER.

569
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,060
I WILL PAY BOTH OF YOU NOT TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IN FRONT OF ME.

570
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,130
IT'S NOT IN FRONT OF YOU. IT'S TO THE SIDE AND BEHIND YOU.

571
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,590
YOU CAN'T RIDE IN THE FRONT,CHUCK.

572
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,750
Narrator: TRAGICALLY FOR JEANINE,

573
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,950
IT DIDN'T MATTER WHERE SHE SAT.

574
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,570
THERE YOU GO. GOOD AS NEW.

575
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,820
DO I LOOK OKAY?

576
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,600
RUNWAY READY. REALLY?

577
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,670
YOU DON'T THINK THESE BANDAGES MAKE ME LOOK FAT?

578
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,030
NO,NOT AT ALL.

579
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:15,610
THAT'S SO SWEET. IS HE ALWAYS THIS SWEET?

580
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,510
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

581
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,950
LOOK,SOME CAR BOMBER JUST WENT THROUGH A LOT OF TROUBLE

582
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,250
TO KEEP YOU FROM SHOWING US WHATEVER IT IS YOU WANTED TO SHOW US.

583
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,720
THE BODIES.

584
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,260
WHAT BODIES? THE DEAD BODIES?

585
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,530
WE ALREADY FOUND THE DEAD BODIES.

586
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,880
NO. THE ONES IN THE BIG HOLE.

587
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,160
HOW SAD.

588
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,510
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY DO THIS?

589
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,210
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

590
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,190
WHAT IS ALL THAT?

591
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,100
EACH ONE OF THESE GUYS IS FITTED WITH A COMPUTER HARD DRIVE

592
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,990
TO RECORD ANY OF THE CRASH-TEST DATA.

593
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,140
YOU BURY THE DUMMIES,YOU BURY THE DATA.

594
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,610
COULDN'T THEY JUST ERASE IT?

595
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,650
YOU NEVER CAN COMPLETELY ERASE ANYTHING.

596
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:04,090
WHY ARE DEAD PEOPLE ON HOOKS AND PLASTIC DUMMIES IN A GRAVE?

597
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,940
THE COMPANY MUST HAVE SWITCHED TO CADAVERS

598
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,410
SO THAT THERE'D BE NO PERMANENT RECORD OF THE CRASH-TEST RESULTS,

599
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,810
'CAUSE DEAD PEOPLE DON'T TALK...

600
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,740
USUALLY.

601
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,380
Narrator: AS THE PIE MAKER'S BRAIN CRACKLED

602
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,730
WITH 10,000 VOLTS OF ELECTRICITY AND THEN LOST CONSCIOUSNESS,

603
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,800
OLIVE WOULD HAVE NO SUCH LUCK.

604
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,350
DIGBY,YOU AWAKE?

605
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,090
I CAN'T SLEEP,EITHER.

606
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,960
Narrator: CLOSING HER EYES ONLY MADE HER VISIONS

607
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,070
OF THE PIE MAKER'S LATE-NIGHT DATE

608
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,000
WITH THE PERKY BRUNETTE FROM NOWHERE

609
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,100
MORE VIVID AND UNCENSORED.

610
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,970
OH! YUCK.

611
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,220
Narrator: OLIVE DECIDED SHE WAS DONE LYING DOWN ABOUT THIS.

612
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,360
WE ARE UP. WE ARE WALKING.

613
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,430
[ Muffled ] LOOK.

614
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,000
AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING IS A DIRTY BUSINESS.

615
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,780
Narrator: MURDER WAS NOT NEW FOR MARK CHASE.

616
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,840
LUCKILY,BODY BAGS KEEP THINGS NICE AND NEAT.

617
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,270
Narrator: THE FACTS WERE THESE.

618
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,710
THROUGH A SERIES OF CRASH-TEST EXPEMENTS,

619
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,180
BERNARD SLAYBE HAD LEARNED THAT THE DANDY LION

620
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,890
WAS A DEADLY DUD.

621
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,240
BERNARD BEGGED THE PRESIDENT TO CANCEL THE CAR'S LAUNCH,

622
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:20,270
BUT MARK CHASE HAD OTHER PLANS.

623
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,080
LIKE A SMOKING GUN,THE SMOKING DUMMIES WOULD HAVE TO BE BURIED.

624
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,500
THE COMPANY HAD INVESTED MILLIONS IN THE DANDY LION,

625
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,790
AND HE KNEW THAT KEEPING THIS TERRIBLE SECRET

626
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,370
WOULD STILL BE CHEAPER THAN HALTING PRODUCTION OF THE CAR.

627
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,490
A DECISION WAS MADE,A COVER-UP UNDERTAKEN.

628
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,530
IF THE DUMMIES HAD TO GO,

629
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,560
SO WOULD ANY DUMMY WHO GOT IN THE WAY.

630
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,220
AS HE REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS AND HURTLED TOWARD THE CRASH-TEST WALL,

631
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,880
BERNARD'S ONLY THOUGHTS WERE OF JEANINE

632
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,520
AND HOW HE WISHED HE'D TOLD HER HE LOVED HER.

633
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,370
MARK CHASE'S ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND GIFT FOR PLANNING

634
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:34,060
HAD SERVED HIM WELL AS A C.E.O.,AND NOW AGAIN AS A MURDERER.

635
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,400
HIS COVER-UP COMPLETE,

636
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,000
HIS ONLY THOUGHTS WERE THAT THE DANDY LION SX

637
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:41,470
WOULD BLOOM ON TIME AND NO ONE WOULD STOP HIM.

638
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,820
THE DANDY LION CAR IS THE CULMINATION OF MY LIFE'S WORK.

639
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,250
IT IS A FLOWER-POWERED PHENOMENON

640
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,660
BORNE OF A THOUSAND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS,

641
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,850
INTENSE RITALIN ABUSE,

642
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,870
AND A LONG-SUBLIMATED INTEREST IN BOTANY.

643
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:58,510
SO WHAT IF IN THE UNLIKELY BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE EVENT

644
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,470
THAT THE CAR GETS UP TO A SPEED OF 70 MILES AN HOUR,

645
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,230
WITH THE HEADLIGHTS ON AND THE SEAT WARMER ON LOW,

646
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,620
A SHORT-CIRCUIT IN THE RADIO

647
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,420
CAUSES A CATACLYSMIC CHAIN REACTION

648
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,340
THAT BLOWS THE CAR AND ITS PRECIOUS HUMAN CARGO TO SMITHEREENS?!

649
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,210
Narrator: AS MARK CHASE CONTINUED HIS MONOLOGUE,

650
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,530
UNAWARE THAT IT WAS COMPLETELY INAUDIBLE

651
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,490
FROM WITHIN THE SEALED BODY BAGS WITHIN THE CAR,

652
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:20,490
CHUCK PONDERED WHY IT WAS SHE ALWAYS SEEMED TO DIE

653
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,170
JUST AS THINGS WERE STARTING TO GET GOOD.

654
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,790
SON OF A BITCH.

655
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,100
WHAT?

656
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,710
Narrator: AND THOUGH HE COULDN'T HEAR HER,

657
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,350
NED SUDDENLY WANTED TO TELL HER EVERYTHING --

658
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,720
PET PEEVES AND FAVORITE FOODS,

659
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,800
HIS FEARS,HIS DREAMS,

660
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,010
AND ALL THE PURE JOY SHE HAD BROUGHT INTO HIS LIFE.

661
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,680
SAYONARA.

662
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,270
Narrator: THIS WAS THE END ALL OVER AGAIN.

663
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,760
GOODBYE.

664
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,750
Narrator: EMERSON COD DID NOT LIKE TO KNIT IN PUBLIC,

665
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,740
BUT HE OFTEN LEFT THE HOUSE WITH THE NEEDLES IN HIS POCKET,

666
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:22,980
SHOULD THE OPPORTUNITY TO RIB-STITCH A SKI CAP PRESENT ITSELF.

667
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,790
DRIVE! OOH!

668
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:57,060
Narrator: IF ONLY THE PIE MAKER HAD HEARD THE KILLER EXPLAIN

669
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:01,340
THAT THE DANDY LION SX WAS MUCH MORE THAN AN ECO-FRIENDLY CAR OF THE FUTURE.

670
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,550
IF ONLY HE'D HEARD IT WAS ALSO A DEATHTRAP,

671
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,280
A DANDELION-FUELED TIME BOMB.

672
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,970
COME ON. JUST A LITTLE FASTER.

673
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,700
CAN'T THIS CAR GO ANY FASTER?!

674
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,210
SOME CAR OF THE FUTURE THIS IS!

675
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,830
I THOUGHT THE CAR OF THE FUTURE WAS SUPPOSED TO FLY.

676
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,200
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO FLYING CARS?

677
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,310
Narrator: IN THE UNLIKELY BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE EVENT

678
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,780
OF REACHING THE SPEED OF 70 MILES AN HOUR

679
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,800
WITH THE HEADLIGHTS ON AND THE SEAT WARMER SET TO LOW,

680
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,550
A SHORT-CIRCUIT IN THE RADIO

681
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,280
WOULD SET OFF A CATACLYSMIC CHAIN REACTION

682
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:17,800
THAT WOULD BLOW THE CAR AND ITS PRECIOUS HUMAN CARGO TO SMITHEREENS.

683
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,730
JEANINE HAD BEEN THE FIRST UNFORTUNATE VICTIM,AND NOW...

684
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,070
WATCH OUT!

685
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:38,170
Narrator: THE PIE MAKER HAD NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY TO SEE OLIVE.

686
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,850
OLIVE HAD NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY TO SEE THE PIE MAKER.

687
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,170
YOU OKAY?

688
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,320
I AM NOW.

689
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,810
WHATEVER THE PIE MAKER HAD BEEN DOING THAT NIGHT

690
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,380
DID NOT SEEM ESPECIALLY ROMANTIC.

691
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,550
CAN YOU HELP US GET OUT OF THESE BODY BAGS?

692
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,060
SURE.

693
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,440
Narrator: MARK CHASE'S CHASE HAD COME TO AN END.

694
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,640
HIS PLAN FOILED AND THE POLICE NOW CLOSING IN,

695
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,770
THE CAR MAKER TRIED TO FLEE,

696
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,210
ONLY TO DISCOVER HE WAS OUT OF GAS.

697
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,380
UNLIKE THE PIE MAKER AND HIS FRIENDS,

698
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,180
THE DANDY LION CAR COMPANY DID NOT SURVIVE

699
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,750
ONCE ITS DARK SECRETS WERE REVEALED.

700
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:21,100
THOSE RESPONSIBLE WERE PUNISHED FOR THEIR WICKED WAYS.

701
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,830
OTHERS,STRENGTHENED BY THE NEWS

702
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:32,280
THAT THEIR LOVED ONES HAD NOT DIED IN VAIN,

703
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,930
REACHED OUT FOR THE HELP AND ROUND-THE-CLOCK SURVEILLANCE

704
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,810
BY A NUTRITION PROFESSIONAL THAT THEY NEEDED.

705
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:47,780
AND EMERSON COD REALIZED HE WOULD NOT BE NOT KNITTING ANYTIME SOON,

706
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,770
AS THE DEAD GIRL,WHO WAS NOT DEAD,

707
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,270
APPEARED TO BE STAYING PUT...

708
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,770
SWEET.

709
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:00,420
...A FACT THE PIE MAKER CELEBRATED.

710
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,990
NOT GIVING UP,DIGBY.

711
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,940
Ned: GET IN.

712
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,420
THE FRONT?

713
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,360
[ KNOCKS ] YOU DID THIS?

714
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,370
YOU CAN DRIVE NOW,TOO,IF YOU WANT...

715
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,340
BUT I KIND OF LOVE DRIVING.

716
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,890
REALLY? I DIDN'T KNOW THAT ABOUT YOU.

717
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,470
WHAT IS THAT?

718
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,590
IT'S FOR,UM...

719
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,080
STEERING EMERGENCIES.

720
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,400
Narrator: HE LIED.

721
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,130
PERFECT.

722
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,070
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

723
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,110
rrator: SHE LIED,TOO.
