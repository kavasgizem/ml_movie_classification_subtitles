The future of our

164

A vampire breached our realm because
he'd had a taste of faerie blood.

Your blood.

nearly drank us to extinction.

onto this plane.

never meant to leave you.

00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:20,659
(LAUGHING) Whoa!

797
00:42:29,398 --> 00:42:30,665
Mmm.

(PHONE BEEPS)

799
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:32,867
Shit.

800
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:34,268
Ugh, switch it off.

801
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,502
(PHONE BEEPS)

802
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,181
Babe, what's wrong?

803
00:42:46,215 --> 00:42:47,417
It's uh...

804
00:42:48,855 --> 00:42:50,023
from my dad.

805
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:53,895
My grandma passed.

806
00:42:55,398 --> 00:42:57,633
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.

807
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:59,101
He texted that to you?

808
00:43:00,837 --> 00:43:04,273
Yeah, they're not the
best communicators.

809
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:08,677
Do you need to go
home for the funeral?

810
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:13,783
You know what? I'll probably
just send flowers.

811
00:43:13,817 --> 00:43:16,351
You sure? Toni, your family
would want you in Atlanta.

812
00:43:20,823 --> 00:43:22,024
Nah.

813
00:43:24,827 --> 00:43:26,328
I think I'm better off here.

814
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,702
(CHUCKLING)

815
00:43:36,873 --> 00:43:40,676
Sid Matt, poor thing. He's been in and out
of the hospital nine, ten months now.

816
00:43:40,711 --> 00:43:43,646
He tells me, "Portia,
the firm's all yours,"

817
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,749
but I think people still like to see
his name on the cards and signs.

818
00:43:47,783 --> 00:43:49,117
Is the cappuccino okay?

819
00:43:51,387 --> 00:43:52,887
It's in the ballpark.

820
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:57,192
I had to improvise.
No one's ever ordered a cappuccino here.

821
00:43:57,226 --> 00:44:00,275
So I tracked down your buyer, AIK.

822
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,200
Turns out their address is
a PO box in the Caribbean.

823
00:44:02,231 --> 00:44:04,731
Phone number is
an answering service.

824
00:44:04,756 --> 00:44:06,056
I can keep on it,
but it may take some time.

825
00:44:06,069 --> 00:44:08,203
You know my hourly rate.

826
00:44:08,237 --> 00:44:12,173
I'm sure someone with your skill
can do it in half the time.

827
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:14,010
Honestly, they must
have put around

828
00:44:14,035 --> 00:44:16,035
fifty thousand worth of
improvements into that house.

829
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,246
They'd at least want to
be compensated for that.

830
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:21,683
Can't we negotiate some kind
of settlement, a payment plan?

831
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,619
I'll get a hold of
someone at AIK.

832
00:44:24,654 --> 00:44:27,522
Maybe we can appeal to
their sense of compassion.

833
00:44:28,424 --> 00:44:29,591
Thank you.

834
00:44:31,027 --> 00:44:34,029
There's a lifetime of memories
in that house for me.

835
00:44:34,063 --> 00:44:37,065
(DISTORTED) <i>Lifetime</i> <i>of misery and
murder,</i> <i>she means. Oh, poor girl.</i>

<i>Plus all those nights</i>
<i>bangin' Bill Compton.</i>

837
00:44:39,068 --> 00:44:41,502
<i>Must have been crazy for him,</i>
<i>doin' his vampire business.</i>

838
00:44:41,537 --> 00:44:43,766
<i>Wonder if she'll go crawlin' back.</i>

839
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:45,191
<i>Better not. He hardly</i>
<i>mentions her at all.</i>

840
00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:46,774
Bill okay?

841
00:44:46,808 --> 00:44:48,108
I'm sorry, excuse me?

842
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,977
Can I send you a bill?

843
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:51,812
Oh yeah. Sure, of course.

847
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:23,612
Nice to meet you.

848
00:45:23,647 --> 00:45:27,350
And I was thinkin' that you were way too
beautiful to be alone here tonight.

849
00:45:28,586 --> 00:45:30,788
And I figure it
couldn't hurt to ask.

(DISTORTED HEARTBEAT)

00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:42,699
Actually, uh, I'm here
with my boyfriend.

852
00:45:42,733 --> 00:45:43,767
Sorry.

853
00:45:43,801 --> 00:45:45,001
It's my loss.

854
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,678
It's uh, O-neg with a
twist of B-five.

855
00:45:58,647 --> 00:46:00,181
You dance with a
drink in your hand?

856
00:46:06,452 --> 00:46:08,019
Sorry I lost my
temper with you.

857
00:46:09,888 --> 00:46:11,922
I know.

858
00:46:11,957 --> 00:46:13,524
I'm sorry, too.

859
00:46:16,228 --> 00:46:18,497
HOYT: You glad we came?
I know it's been a while.

860
00:46:18,531 --> 00:46:21,254
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just
gonna go touch myself up.

861
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:22,479
I'll be right back.

Sorry, I just...

865
00:46:48,196 --> 00:46:49,897
I needed a minute.

866
00:46:51,466 --> 00:46:54,068
It's been ages.

867
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:58,639
Not a letter, a telegram, a smoke signal.
We've been worried sick about you.

868
00:46:58,673 --> 00:46:59,874
Really?
Not really.

869
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:02,777
Well, I'm fine.

870
00:47:04,012 --> 00:47:06,413
Me and Hoyt, we,
we moved in together.

871
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:09,550
That tree with the plaid
shirt, it has a name?

872
00:47:09,584 --> 00:47:13,487
Well, he seems sweet and all, if
you're into that sort of thing,

873
00:47:13,521 --> 00:47:18,025
but if you're making him bring you here,
I've got a hunch it's not enough.

874
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,429
Well, it was his idea. You
know, like a date night.

Mmm.

876

The way you're eye-fucking
fang-bangers from across the room,

that's especially romantic.

You had no reason to feel
guilty. You're a hunter.

Don't you think if all I wanted
to do was kill and fuck,

883
00:47:47,388 --> 00:47:49,756
that I'd be out there
doin' it right now?

Mmm.

885

Look, I don't even know what you
saw or what you think you saw,

886
00:47:54,295 --> 00:47:57,397
but when I go home tonight, I'm
goin' home with the man I love,

887
00:47:57,432 --> 00:47:59,032
and I'm just sorry
that you never had that.

EMORY: What's that?

Tommy's apartment.

Oh, well, that's great.

00:48:14,915 --> 00:48:16,549
No. It brought it all back.

00:48:23,389 --> 00:48:25,957
And I knew it was wrong even
before I pulled the trigger.

899
00:48:25,991 --> 00:48:28,726
It was like some other
person fired that gun,

900
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,995
and there was nothin' I
could do to stop him.

901

Oh, yeah. I've been there.

902
00:48:32,064 --> 00:48:33,397
Mmm, me, too.

All of us.

904
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:38,068
Yeah, luckily, I didn't
have a gun at the time,

905
00:48:38,103 --> 00:48:41,205
(LAUGHING) or I'd have been
a widow a long time ago.

It's primal, Sam.

907

We wouldn't be who we are
if we didn't get emotional.

You can even measure the
cortisol levels in your blood.

I bet we're all
just naturally higher.

910

You know what helps the
cortisol levels in my blood?

Gotta teach?

920
00:49:05,364 --> 00:49:07,898
It's public education. Who's
gonna know the difference?

00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:33,383
You gonna get sick if
you eat raw meat.

954

(KIDS LAUGHING)

955
00:50:35,053 --> 00:50:37,254
We ain't never got
sick before.

956
00:50:37,288 --> 00:50:39,056
You want the rest
of my hangubber?

957
00:50:40,325 --> 00:50:41,525
Ugh.

958
00:50:43,828 --> 00:50:46,996
Yeah, we really need to get your
Aunt Crystal back here ASAP.

959
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:49,265
Y'all could use a mama,
and I could use a break.

960
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:51,634
Didn't you talk to
Aunt Crystal?

961
00:50:51,668 --> 00:50:54,309
Not yet. But I could think
of one or two things

962
00:50:54,334 --> 00:50:55,337
I'd like to tell her when
I do find her.

963
00:50:55,338 --> 00:50:56,339
BOY: Let me have some of that!

964
00:50:56,373 --> 00:50:58,307
Dude.

965
00:50:58,341 --> 00:51:00,276
Hey, Mister Jason?

966
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:03,078
The, the ice box
ain't cold or nothin'.

967
00:51:03,113 --> 00:51:04,912
Well, are you sure?
'Cause I just fixed it.

968
00:51:08,216 --> 00:51:09,383
Come on.

969
00:51:15,524 --> 00:51:17,857
Oh, shoot. You left it open?

970
00:51:17,892 --> 00:51:20,060
Yeah, well, that's our
air conditionin'.

971
00:51:23,297 --> 00:51:26,566
No wonder you busted it.

972
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:29,636
Now I'm gonna have to replace
the cooling element.

973
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:30,837
Oh!

974
00:51:33,374 --> 00:51:35,074
JASON: Oh, fuck!

975
00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:36,776
Wait! Timbo, what the...

976
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:38,411
Hey!

977
00:51:38,445 --> 00:51:40,846
I'm gonna suffocate in here!

978
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,080
Come on.

979
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:46,152
Minerva was much more
than a pet to me.

980
00:51:49,723 --> 00:51:52,458
She was my friend,
my companion,

981
00:51:54,061 --> 00:51:55,260
my familiar.

982
00:51:58,131 --> 00:52:00,232
I, I was wondering why
she stopped eating,

983
00:52:00,267 --> 00:52:02,401
but now I realize it was
her way of telling me that

984
00:52:02,435 --> 00:52:04,670
she had more work to do
in the spirit world.

985
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,841
I've uh, looked up a ritual

986
00:52:11,511 --> 00:52:13,279
to ease her passage there.

987
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:17,383
Would you all join
me, for Minerva?

988
00:52:25,027 --> 00:52:26,560

Restore within her

Marnie, we haven't
studied this.

I'm sorry after all that trouble,
your bird's still dead.

Excuse me!

1027
00:56:13,887 --> 00:56:15,020
Mmm.

1028
00:56:16,522 --> 00:56:18,823
Such a strange sensation
when the reality matches

1029
00:56:18,857 --> 00:56:21,659
what you've pictured in
your mind so precisely.

1030
00:56:23,495 --> 00:56:25,262
Is this another dream?

1031
00:56:25,296 --> 00:56:28,164
It's been a year. How much of
your blood is left in me?

1032
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:30,767
Oh, it's not a dream,
I assure you.

1033
00:56:30,801 --> 00:56:33,369
Then how are you here? I
rescinded your invitation.

1034
00:56:33,403 --> 00:56:35,271
You don't own the
house anymore.

1035
00:56:39,843 --> 00:56:41,710
I do.

1036
00:56:41,745 --> 00:56:44,546
Why would you do that? Why
would you buy my house?

1037
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:47,082
Because I always
knew you were alive,

1038
00:56:47,116 --> 00:56:48,983
and if I owned the house,

1039
00:56:49,985 --> 00:56:51,152
then I would own you.
