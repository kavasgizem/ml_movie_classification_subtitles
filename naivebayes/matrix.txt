ls everything in place?
You are not to relieve me.
I know, but I felt like taking a shift.
You like him, do not you?
You like watching him.
do not be ridiculous.
We are going to kill him.
Morpheus believes he is the One.
Do you?
It does not matter what I believe.
You do not, do you?
Did you hear that?
Hear what?
Are you sure this line is clean?
Yeah, of course I am sure.
I better go.
Freeze! Police!
Hands on your head!
Do it! Do it now!
Lieutenant.
Oh, shit.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders.
I am just doing my job.
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion" crap, you can cram it up your ass.
The orders were for your protection.
I think we can handle one little girl.
I sent two units!
They are bringing her down now!
No, lieutenant, your men are already dead.
Shit.
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I do not know how.
I know. They cut the hard line.
There is no time.
Get to another exit.
Are there any agents?
Yes.
Goddamn it.
You have to focus, Trinity.
There is a phone at Wells and Lake
You can make it.
All right.
Go.
that is impossible.
Get up, Trinity. Just get up.
Get up.
She got out.
It does not matter.
The informant is real.
Yes.
We have the name of their next target.
The name is Neo.
We will need a search running.
It has already begun.
What?
What the hell?
"Follow the white rabbit."
Who is it?
It is Choi.
Yeah. Yeah.
You are two hours late.
I know. It is her fault.
You got the money?
Two grand.
Hold on.
Hallelujah.
You are my savior.
My own personal Jesus Christ.
You get caught using that
I know. This never happened.
You do not exist.
Right.
Something wrong, man?
You look a little whiter than usual.
My computer, it
Ever have that feeling where you are
not sure if you are awake or dreaming?
All the time.
It is called mescaline.
It is the only way to fly.
It just sounds like you
need to unplug.
Get some R and R?
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?
Definitely.
No, I can not. I have work tomorrow.
Come on.
It will be fun. I promise.
Yeah.
Sure. I will go.
Hello, Neo.
How do you know that name?
I know a lot about you.
Who are you?
My name is Trinity.
Trinity.
The Trinity?
That cracked the IRS D-base?
That was a long time ago.
Jesus.
What?
I just thought
you were a guy.
Most guys do.
That was you on my computer.
How did you do that?
Right now, all I can tell you
is that you are in danger.
I brought you here to warn you.
Of what?
They are watching you, Neo.
Who is?
Please just listen.
I know why you are here, Neo.
I know what you have been doing.
I know why you hardly sleep
why you live alone and why,
night after night
you sit at your computer.
You are looking for him.
I know, because I was once
looking for the same thing.
And when he found me
he told me I was not really
looking for him
I was looking for an answer.
It is the question that drives us, Neo.
It is the question
that brought you here.
You know the question
just as I did.
What is the Matrix?
The answer is out there, Neo.
It is looking for you.
And it Will find you
if you want it to.
Shit.
Shit, shit.
You have a problem with authority,
Mr. Anderson.
You believe that you are special,
that the rules do not apply to you.
Obviously, you are mistaken.
This is one of the top
software companies in the world
because employees understand
they are part of a whole.
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth
or you choose to find another job.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.
Thomas Anderson?
Yeah, that is me.
Okay.
Great.
Have a nice day.
Hello?
Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?
Morpheus.
Yes.
I have been looking for you.
I do not know if you are ready to see
what I want to show you.
But unfortunately, you and I
have run out of time.
They are coming for you, and I do not know
what they are going to do.
Who is coming for me?
Stand up and see for yourself.
What? Right now?
Yes. Now.
Do it slowly.
The elevator.
Oh, shit!
Yes.
What do they want?
I do not know. If you do not want
to find out, get out of there.
How?
I can guide you,
but you must do exactly as I say.
Okay.
The cubicle across from you is empty.
But what if they--
Go. Now.
Stay here for just a moment.
When I tell you,
go to the end of the row
to the office
at the end of the hall.
Stay as low as you can.
Go. Now.
Good. Now, outside
there is a scaffold.
How do you know this?
We do not have time.
To your left there is a window.
Go to it.
Open it.
Take the scaffold to the roof.
No way! No way!
This is crazy!
There are two ways
out of this building.
One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.
You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.
This is insane!
Why is this happening to me'?
what would I do?
I am nobody.
I did not do anything.
I am gonna die.
Shit!
Oh, shit!
I can not do this.
Shit.
As you can see, we have had our eye on
you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
It seems that you have been living
two lives.
In one life,
you are Thomas A. Anderson
program writer for
a respectable software company.
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.
And you
help your landlady
carry out her garbage.
The other life is lived in computers
where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"
and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.
One of these lives
has a future.
And one of them does not.
I am going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.
You are here
because we need your help.
We know that you have been contacted
by a certain
individual.
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.
He is considered by many authorities
to be the most dangerous man alive.
My colleagues
believe that I am wasting
my time with you.
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.
We are willing to wipe the slate clean
give you a fresh start.
All we are asking in return
is your cooperation
in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.
Yeah.
That sounds like a really good deal.
But I got a better one.
How about
I give you the finger
and you give me my phone call.
Mr. Anderson
you disappoint me.
You can not scare me
with this gestapo crap.
I know my rights.
I want my phone call.
Tell me, Mr. Anderson
what good is a phone call
if you are unable to speak?
You are going to help us,
Mr. Anderson
whether you want to or not.
This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.
They got to you first, but they have
underestimated how important you are.
If they knew what I know
you would probably be dead.
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?
You are the One, Neo. You may have
spent the last few years
looking for me, but I have spent
my entire life
looking for you.
Now, do you still want to meet?
Yes.
Then go to the Adams Street bridge.
Get in.
What is this?
It is necessary, Neo.
For our protection.
From what?
From you.
Take off your shirt.
What?
Stop the car.
Listen, coppertop.
We do not have time for 20 Questions.
Right now, there is only one rule:
Our way
or the highway.
Fine.
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.
Why?
Because you have been down there.
You know that road.
You know exactly where it ends.
And I know that is
not where you want to be.
Apoc, lights.
Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.
What is that?
You are bugged.
Try and relax.
Come on.
Come on.
It is on the move.
Come on, you shit.
You are gonna lose it.
No, I am not.
Clear!
Jesus Christ!
That thing is real!?
This is it.
Let me give you one piece of advice.
Be honest.
He knows more than you can imagine.
At last.
Welcome, Neo.
As you no doubt have guessed
I am Morpheus.
It is an honor to meet you.
No
the honor is mine.
Please, come. Sit.
I imagine
that right now you are feeling
a bit like Alice
tumbling down the rabbit hole?
You could say that.
I can see it in your eyes.
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees
because he is expecting to wake up.
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.
Do you believe in fate, Neo?
No.
Why not?
I do not like the idea that
I am not in control of my life.
I know exactly what you mean.
Let me tell you why you are here.
You know something.
What you know,
you can not explain.
But you feel it.
You felt it your entire life:
Something is wrong with the world.
You do not know what, but it is there.
Like a splinter in your mind
driving you mad.
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.
Do you know what
I am talking about?
The Matrix?
Do you want to know
what it is?
The Matrix is everywhere.
It is all around us.
Even now, in this very room.
You can see it when you
look out your window
or when you turn on your television.
You can feel it when you go to work
when you go to church
when you pay your taxes.
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes
to blind you from the truth.
What truth?
That you are a slave.
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage
born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.
A prison
for your mind.
Unfortunately, no one can be
told what the Matrix is.
You have to see it for yourself.
This is your last chance.
After this, there is no turning back.
You take the blue pill
the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe
whatever you want to believe.
You take the red pill
you stay in Wonderland
and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.
Remember
all I am offering is the truth.
Nothing more.
Follow me.
Apoc, are we on-line?
Almost.
Time is always against us.
Please take a seat there.
You did all this?
Mm-hm.
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.
What does that mean?
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy
because Kansas
is going bye-bYe-
Did you?
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?
How would you know the difference
between the dream world
and the real world?
This can not be.
Be what?
Be real?
Going into replication.
Apoc?
Still nothing.
It is cold.
It is cold!
Tank, we will need a signal soon.
I got a fibrillation.
Apoc, location.
Targeting almost there.
He is going into arrest.
Lock. I got him!
Now, Tank, now!
Welcome
to the real world.
We have done it, Trinity.
We found him.
I hope you are right.
I do not have to hope.
I know it.
Am I dead?
Far from it.
He still needs a lot of work.
What are you doing?
Your muscles atrophied.
We are rebuilding them.
WW do my eyes hurt?
You have never used them before.
Rest, Neo.
The answers are coming.
Morpheus, what is happened to me?
What is this place?
More important than "what" is "when."
"When"?
You believe it is the year 1999
when in fact, it is closer to 2199.
I can not tell you exactly
what year it is
because we honestly do not know.
There is nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.
Come with me.
See for yourself.
This is my ship.
The Nebuchadnezzar.
It is a hovercraft.
This is the main deck.
This is the core
where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.
Most of my crew you already know.
This is Apoc
Switch
-and Cypher.
Hi.
The ones you do not know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.
The little one behind you is Mouse.
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?
Trinity.
Try to relax.
This will feel a little weird.
This
is the Construct.
It is our loading program.
We can load anything, from clothing
to equipment
weapons
training simulations
anything we need.
Right now we are inside
a computer program?
Is it really so hard to believe?
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.
Your hair has changed.
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.
This is not real?
What is "real"?
How do you define "real"?
If you are talking about
what you can feel
what you can smell, taste and see
then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.
This is the world that you know.
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation
that we call the Matrix.
You have been living
in a dream world, Neo.
This is the world
as it exists today.
Welcome to "the desert
of the real."
We have only bits and pieces
of information.
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21st century
all of mankind was united
in celebration.
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to Al.
AI.
You mean artificial intelligence.
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.
We do not know who struck first,
us or them.
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.
They were dependent on solar power
and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive
without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.
Combined with a form of fusion
the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields
where human beings
are no longer born.
We are grown.
For the longest time,
I would not believe it.
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes
watched them liquefy the dead
so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision
I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.
What is the Matrix?
Control.
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world
built to keep us under control
in order to change a human being
into this.
No.
I do not believe it.
It is not possible.
I did not say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.
S'tOp!
Let me out!
Let me out! I want out!
Easy, Neo. Easy.
Get this thing out of me.
Get this thing out of me!
do not touch me!
Stay away from me!
I do not believe it.
I do not believe it.
I do not believe it.
He is gonna pop.
Breathe, Neo.
Just breathe.
I can not go back, can I?
No.
But if you could
would you really want to?
I owe you an apology.
We have a rule.
We never free a mind
once it is reached a certain age.
It is dangerous.
The mind has trouble letting go.
I have seen it before, and I am sorry.
I did what I did because
I had to.
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside
who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted
to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.
It was he who freed the first of us
taught us the truth.
As long as the Matrix exists
the human race will never be free.
After he died
the Oracle prophesied his return
and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix
end the war
bring freedom to our people.
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix
looking for him.
I did what I did because
I believe that search is over.
Get some rest.
You are going to need it.
For what?
Your training.
Morning. Did you sleep?
You will tonight.
I guarantee it.
I am Tank. I will be your operator.
You do not have any--
Holes? Nope.
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.
Born free right here
in the real world.
Genuine child of Zion.
Zion?
If the war was over tomorrow
Zion is where the party would be.
It is a city?
The last human city.
The only place we have left.
Where is it?
Deep underground near the Earth is core,
where it is still warm.
You live long enough,
you might see it.
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I am excited
to see what you are capable of
if Morpheus is right and all.
We are not supposed to
talk about this, but
if you are
it is a very exciting time.
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.
We are supposed to start
with these programs first.
that is major boring shit.
let's do something more fun.
How about
combat training?
Jujitsu"?
I am going to learn jujitsu?
Holy shit!
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."
How about some more?
Hell, yes.
Hell, yeah.
How is he?
Ten hours straight.
He is a machine.
I know kung fu.
Show me.
This is a sparring program
similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.
Some of them can be bent.
Others can be broken.
Understand?
Then hit me
if you can.
Good!
Adaptation.
Improvisation.
But your weakness
is not your technique.
Morpheus is fighting Neo.
How did I beat you?
You are too fast.
Do you believe that
my being stronger or faster
has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?
You think you are breathing air?
Again!
Jesus Christ, he is fast!
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.
What are you waiting for?
You are faster than this.
do not think you are.
Know you are.
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!
I do not believe it.
I know what you are trying to do.
I am trying to free your mind, Neo.
But I can only show you the door.
You have to walk through it.
Tank, load the jump program.
You have to let it all go, Neo
Feat“
doubt and disbelief.
Free your mind.
Whoa.
Okey-dokey.
Free my mind.
What if he makes it?
No one is ever made their first jump.
I know.
But what if he does?
He wo not.
Come on.
All right.
No problem. Free my mind.
Free my mind. No problem. Right.
What does that mean?
It does not mean anything.
Everybody falls the first time.
Right, Trin?
I thought it was not real.
Your mind makes it real.
If you are killed in the Matrix
you die here?
The body cannot live without the mind.
I do not remember you ever
bringing me dinner.
There is something about him,
is not there?
You are a believer now?
I keep wondering
if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?
Morpheus will take him
when he is ready.
The Matrix is a system, Neo.
That system is our enemy.
But when you are inside,
what do you see?
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system
and that makes them our enemy.
You have to understand
most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.
And many of them are so inert
so hopelessly dependent
on the system
that they will fight to protect it.
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?
I was--
Look again.
Freeze it.
This is not the Matrix?
No.
It is another training program
designed to teach you one thing:
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.
What are they?
Sentient programs.
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.
That means that anyone
we have not unplugged
is potentially an agent.
Inside the Matrix
they are everyone
and they are no one.
We have survived by hiding
and running from them
but they are the gatekeepers.
They are guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.
Someone?
I wo not lie to you, Neo.
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent, has died.
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.
Why?
I have seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.
Because of that
they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.
What are you telling me?
That I can dodge bullets?
No, Neo.
I am trying to tell you
that when you are ready
you wo not have to.
We got trouble.
Did Zion send the warning?
No, another ship.
Shit.
Squiddy is sweeping in quick.
Squiddy?
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.
Search and destroy.
Set her down there.
How are we doing, Tank?
Power off-line.
EMP armed
-and ready
EMF'?
Electromagnetic pulse.
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.
It is the only weapon we have
against the machines.
Where are we?
Their old service and waste systems.
Sewers.
There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.
Now these sewers are
all that is left.
Quiet.
Whoa! Neo.
You scared the bejesus out of me.
Sorry.
It is okay.
Is that?
The Matrix?
Yeah.
Do you always look at it encoded?
Well, you have to.
The image translators work
for the construct program.
But there is way too much information
to decode the Matrix.
You get used to it.
I do not even see the code.
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.
Do you
want a drink?
Sure.
You know
I know what you are thinking.
Because right now I am thinking
the same thing.
Actually, I have been thinking it
ever since I got here.
Why, oh, why did not I take
the blue pill?
Good shit, huh?
Dozer makes it.
It is good for two things:
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.
So can I ask you something?
Did he tell you why he did it?
Why you are here?
Jesus!
What a mind job.
So you are here to save the world.
What do you say
to something like that?
A little piece of advice.
You see an agent
you do what we do:
Run.
You run your ass off.
Thanks for the drink.
Sweet dreams.
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?
You know
I know this steak does not exist.
I know that when I put it
in my mouth
the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is
juicy
and delicious.
After nine years
you know what I realize?
Ignorance is bliss.
Then we have a deal.
I do not want to remember nothing.
Nothing. You understand?
And I want to be rich.
You know, someone important.
Like an actor.
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
Okay.
You get my body
back in a power plant
reinsert me into the Matrix
I will get you what you want.
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.
No. I told you, I do not know them.
I can get you the man who does.
Morpheus.
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.
Close your eyes, it feels
like you are eating runny eggs.
Or a bowl of snot.
You know what it reminds me of?
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?
No, but technically,
neither did you.
that is exactly my point. Exactly.
Because you have to wonder
how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?
Maybe they got it wrong.
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like, actually tasted like
oatmeal or tuna fish.
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.
Maybe they did not know
what to make it taste like
which is why it tastes
like everything.
And maybe they--
Shut up.
It is a single-celled protein
combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.
Everything the body needs.
It does not have everything
the body needs.
I understand you have run through
the agent training program.
You know, I wrote that program.
Here it comes.
What did you think of her?
Of who?
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.
She does not talk very much
but if you would like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.
The digital pimp hard at work.
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.
To deny our own impulses
is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.
Dozer, when you are done
bring the ship up to broadcast depth.
We are going in.
I am taking Neo to see her.
See who?
The Oracle.
Everyone please observe
the "fasten seat belt"
and "no smoking" signs are on.
Sit back and enjoy your flight.
We are in.
We will be back in an hour.
Unbelievable
is not it?
God!
What?
I used to eat there.
Really good noodles.
I have these memories from my life.
None of them happened.
What does that mean?
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.
But an oracle can?
that is different.
Did you go to her?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
She told me
What?
We are here.
Neo, come with me.
So is this the same oracle
that made
the prophecy?
Yes. She is very old. She is been
with us since the beginning.
The beginning?
Of the Resistance.
And she knows what? Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
And she is never wrong.
Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.
She is a guide, Neo.
She can help you to find the path.
She helped you?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
That I would find the One.
I told you I can only
show you the door.
You have to walk through it.
Hello, Neo.
You are right on time.
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.
These are the other Potentials.
You can wait here.
Do not try and bend the spoon.
that is impossible.
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.
What truth?
There is no spoon.
There is no spoon?
Then you will see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.
The Oracle will you see now.
I know you are Neo.
Be right with you.
You are the Oracle?
Bingo.
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?
Almost done.
Smell good, do not they?
Yeah.
I would ask you to sit down
but you are not going to anyway.
And do not worry about the vase.
What vase?
Thatvase.
I am sorry.
I said, do not worry about it.
I will get one of my kids to fix it.
How did you know?
What is really going to bake
your noodle later on is
would you still have broken it
if I had not said anything?
You are cuter than I thought.
I can see why she likes you.
Who?
Not too bright, though.
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.
So
what do you think?
Do you think you are the One?
I do not know.
You know what that means?
It is Latin.
Means, "Know thyself."
I will let you in on a little secret.
Being the One is just
like being in love.
No one can tell you you are in love.
You just know it
through and through.
Balls to bones.
Well
I would better have a look at you.
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."
Qkay
Now I am supposed to say,
"Hmm, that is interesting, but"
Then you say:
But what?
But you already know
what I am going to tell you.
I am not the One.
Sorry, kid.
You got the gift
but it looks like
you are waiting for something.
What?
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?
that is the way these things go.
What is funny?
Morpheus.
He almost had me convinced.
I know.
Poor Morpheus.
Without him, we are lost.
What do you mean, "without him"?
Are you sure you want
to hear this?
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.
And no one, not you, not even me
can convince him otherwise.
He believes it so blindly
that he is going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.
What?
 You are going to
have to make a choice.
In the one hand,
you will have Morpheus' life.
And in the other hand,
you will have your own.
One of you is going to die.
Which one will be up to you.
I am sorry, kiddo. I really am.
You have a good soul.
And I hate giving
good people bad news.
do not worry about it.
As soon as you
step outside that door
you will start feeling better.
You will remember you do not believe
in any of this fate crap.
You are in control of your own life.
Remember?
Here
take a cookie.
I promise, by the time
you are done eating it
you will feel right as rain.
What was said
was for you
and for you alone.
They are on the way.
What is that?
On, déjé vu.
What did you just say?
Nothing.
Just déjé vu.
What did you see?
What happened?
A black cat went past us
then anotherjust like it.
Was it the same cat?
I am not sure.
Switch, Apoc.
What is it?
A dejé vu is usually a glitch in the
Matrix when they change something.
Oh, my God.
let's go.
They out the hard line.
It is a trap! Get out!
Oh, no.
that is what they changed.
We are trapped.
Be calm. Give me your phone.
They will be able to track it.
We have no choice.
Operator.
Find a structural drawing of
this building. Find it fast.
Got it!
I need the main wet-wall
Eighth ﬂoor.
They are on the eighth floor.
Switch, straight ahead.
Neo
I hope the Oracle
gave you some good news.
Now left. that is it.
Good.
Where are they?
They are in the walls.
In the walls!
It is an agent!
Morpheus!
You must get Neo out!
He is all that matters!
No, Morpheus! do not!
Trinity, go!
Go!
We can not leave him!
We have to!
Cypher, come on!
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.
And you are?
A Smith.
Agent Smith.
You all look the same to me.
Take him.
No!
Operator.
I need an exit, fast.
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.
All of a sudden, boom.
Somebody up there still likes me.
l got you.
Just get me out of here fast.
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.
Right.
Operator.
Tank, it is me.
Is Morpheus alive?
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?
Yes. They are moving him.
I do not know where.
He is alive. We need an exit.
You are not far from Cypher.
Cypher?
I know.
I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
Got it.
Got him.
Where are they?
Making the call.
Good.
You first.
Shit!
Tank!
No!
I do not know. It just went dead.
Hello, Trinity.
Cypher? Where is Tank?
You know
for a long time
I thought I was in love with you.
I used to dream about you.
You are a beautiful woman, Trinity.
Too bad things had to
turn out this way.
You killed them.
What?
Oh, God.
I am tired, Trinity.
I am tired of this war
tired of fighting.
I am tired of this ship
of being cold, of eating
the same goddamn goop every day.
But most of all
I am tired of that jackoff
and all of his bullshit.
Surprise, asshole!
I bet you never saw this coming
did you?
God, I wish I could be there
when they break you.
I wish I could walk in
just when it happens
so right then
you would know it was me.
You gave them Morpheus.
He lied to us, Trinity.
He tricked us!
If you had told us the truth
we would have told you to shove
that red pill up your ass!
That is not true, Cypher.
He set us free.
"Free." You call this free?
All I do is what he tells me to do.
If I had to choose between
that and the Matrix
I choose the Matrix.
The Matrix is not real.
I disagree, Trinity.
I think the Matrix
can be more real than this world.
All I do is pull the plug here.
But there
you have to watch Apoc die.
Trinity.
Welcome to the real world.
But you are out, Cypher.
You can not go back.
that is what you think.
They will reinsert my body.
I go back to sleep. When I wake up,
I wo not remember a thing.
By the way
if you have anything important
to say to Switch
say it now.
No, please do not.
Not like this.
Not like this.
Too late.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
do not hate me, Trinity.
I am just a messenger.
And right now,
I am going to prove it to you.
If Morpheus was right
there is no way
I can pull this plug.
If Neo is the One
then there  would have to be
some kind of a miracle to stop me.
Right?
I mean, how can he be the One
if he is dead?
You never did answer me before
if you bought into
Morpheus' bullshit.
Come on. All I want
is a little yes or no.
Look into his eyes
those big, pretty eyes
and tell me
---yes."
OI" I70
Yes.
No!
I do not believe it.
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you are still going to burn!
You first.
You are hurt.
I will be all right.
Doze r?
Have you ever stood and stared at it?
Marveled at its beauty
its genius?
Billions of people
just living out their lives.
Oblivious.
Did you know that the first Matrix
was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered
where everyone would be happy.
It was a disaster.
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.
Some believe that
we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.
But I believe that
as a species
human beings define
their reality through misery
and suffering.
So the perfect world was a dream
that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.
The peak
of your civilization.
I say, "your civilization"
because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization
which is, of course,
what this is all about.
Evolution, Morpheus.
Evolution.
Like the dinosaur.
Look out that window.
You had your time.
The future is our world, Morpheus.
The future is our time.
There could be a problem.
What are they doing to him?
They are breaking into his mind.
It is like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.
How much time?
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it will crack
and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.
When it does, he will tell them
anything they want to know.
What do they want?
The leader of every ship is given
codes to Zion is mainframe computer.
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion is mainframe
they could destroy us.
We can not let that happen.
Trinity, Zion is more important than me
or you
or even Morpheus.
There has to be
something we can do.
There is. We pull the plug.
You are going to kill him?
Kill Morpheus?
We do not have a choice.
Never send a human
to do a machine is job.
If the insider has failed
they will sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless--
They are dead. In either case--
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.
Immediately.
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.
You were a father.
We will miss you always.
S'tOp!
I do not believe this is happening.
Neo, this has to be done.
Does it'?
I do not know.
This can not be just coincidence.
What?
The Oracle.
She told me this would happen.
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.
What choice?
What are you doing?
I am going in.
No, you are not.
I have to.
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.
There is no way
that you are going back in.
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I am something I am not.
What?
I am not the One, Trinity.
The Oracle hit me with that too.
No, you have to be.
I am sorry, I am not.
I am just another guy.
No, Neo, that is not true.
It can not be true.
Why?
This is loco. They have got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you are talking about is suicide.
that is what it looks like
but it is not.
I can not explain to you why it is not.
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.
I understand that now.
that is why I have to go.
Why?
Because I believe in something.
What?
I believe I can bring him back.
What are you doing?
Going with you.
No, you are not.
_IINOII?
Let me tell you what I believe.
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.
And since I am the ranking officer
if you do not like it,
I believe you can go to hell.
Because you are not going anywhere else.
Tank
load us up.
I would like to share
a revelation that I have had
during my time here.
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species
and I realized
that you are not actually mammals.
Every mammal on this planet
instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.
But you humans do not.
You move to an area
and you multiply
and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.
The only way you can survive
is to spread to another area.
There is another organism
on this planet
that follows the same pattern.
Do you know what it is?
A virus.
Human beings are a disease.
A cancer of this planet.
You are a plague.
And we
are the cure.
Okay, so what do you need?
Besides a miracle.
Guns.
Lots of guns.
Neo
No one has ever done
anything like this.
that is why it is going to work.
Why is not the serum working?
Perhaps we are asking
the wrong questions.
Leave me with him.
Now.
Hold on, Morpheus.
They are coming for you.
They are coming.
Can you hear me, Morpheus?
I am going to be honest
with you.
L---
hate
this place
this zoo
this prison
this reality,
whatever you want to call it.
I can not stand it any longer.
It is the smell.
If there is such a thing.
I feel saturated by it.
I can
taste
your stink.
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.
It is repulsive.
is not it?
I must get out of here.
I must get free.
And in this mind is the key.
My key.
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.
Do you understand?
I need the codes.
I have to get inside Zion
and you have to tell me how.
You are going to tell me
or you are going to die.
Please remove any metallic items
you are carrying. Keys, loose change.
Holy shit!
Backup. Send backup.
Freeze!
What were you doing?
He does not know.
Know what?
I think they are trying to save him.
There is no spoon.
Find them and destroy them!
We are under attack!
Trinity!
Help!
Only human.
Dodge this.
How did you do that?
Do what?
You moved like they do.
I have never seen anyone move that fast.
It was not fast enough.
Can you fly that thing?
Not yet.
Operator.
I need a pilot program
for a B-212 helicopter.
Hurry.
let's go.
No.
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.
He is not going to make it.
Got you.
Trinity!
I knew it.
He is the One.
Do you believe it now, Trinity?
Morpheus
The Oracle.
She told me--
She told you
what you needed to hear.
that is all.
Sooner or later you will realize,
just as I did
there is a difference
between knowing the path
and walking the path.
Operator.
Tank.
It is good to hear your voice.
We need an exit.
Got one ready. Subway station,
State and Balboa.
Damn it!
The trace was completed.
We have their position.
Sentinels are standing by.
Order the strike.
They are not out yet.
You first, Morpheus.
Neo, I want to tell you something
but I am afraid of
what it could mean if I do.
Everything the Oracle
told me has come true.
Everything but this.
But what?
Neo!
What happened?
An agent.
Send me back.
I can not.
Mr. Anderson.
Run, Neo. Run.
What is he doing?
He is beginning to believe.
You are empty.
So are you.
I am going to enjoy watching you die
Mr. Anderson.
Jesus, he is killing him.
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?
That is the sound of inevitability.
It is the sound of your death.
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
My name
is Neo.
What happened?
I do not know. I lost him.
Oh, shit.
Sentinels.
How long?
Five, maybe six minutes.
Tank, charge the EMP.
We can not use that until he is out.
I know. do not worry.
He is gonna make it.
Flat or pumps? No, just--
What the shit? that is my phone!
That guy took my phone!
Got him!
He is on the run.
Mr. Wizard, get me out of here!
I got an old exit.
Wabash and Lake.
Oh, shit!
Help! Need a little help!
The door.
The door on your left.
Your other left!
The back door.
Oh, no.
Here they come.
He is going to make it.
The fire escape at the end
of the alley, room 303.
They are inside.
Hurry, Neo.
It can not be.
Check him.
He is gone.
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
Neo
I am not afraid anymore.
The Oracle told me
I would fall in love, and that
the man I loved would be the One.
So you see
you can not be dead.
You can not be
because I love you.
You hear me?
I love you.
Now, get up.
No.
How?
He is the One.
Neo!
I know you are out there.
I can feel you now.
I know that you are afraid.
You are afraid of us.
You are afraid of change.
I do not know the future.
I did not come here to tell you
how this is going to end.
I came here to tell you
how it is going to begin.
I will hang up this phone
And then I will show these people
what you do not want them to see
I am going to show them a world
without you
A world without rules and controls,
without borders or boundaries.
A world where anything is possible.
Where we go from there
is a choice I leave to you
